your ass is toast because I don't like the way your boss runs things over there

252

265
00:10:59,273 --> 00:11:00,707

We are on the same page, my friend,

268
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:08,148
不论是就党派来说 还是就我自身而言
both in terms of the party and, of course, in terms of myself.

269
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:13,186
我现是不是就该问你一个问题了?
Am I supposed to ask a question now?

270

哦 当然 你想的话 问吧

275
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:29,269
那个问题的答案就在

00:11:35,443 --> 00:11:38,178
答案就是某个人
The answer would be a certain someone,

278
00:11:38,213 --> 00:11:41,815
或者我们该说 那个未被充分使用的人
shall we say, whose skills were not adequately tapped.

279
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:44,885
这个问题可够大的
That's some question.

我不认为我之前说得很清楚
I don't think I was actually very clear before.

285
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:08,744
不 我叔叔以前说过
No. - my uncle used to have this saying.

286
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:12,348
他对我说 亲爱的 如果你没在桌上
He used to say to me, Honey, if you're not at the table,

287
00:12:12,382 --> 00:12:14,616
你大概就在菜单里
you're probably on the menu.

288
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:18,020
Kent 我不会被吃掉的
And, Kent, I will not be eaten.

289
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:21,389
为什么有人想要吃了你?
Why would anyone want to eat you?

290
00:12:21,423 --> 00:12:24,459
你知道我现在不用竞选什么职位吧?
You do know that I am not running for office right now?

291
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,161
我 事实上就是副总统
I am, in fact, the vice president.

292
00:12:26,195 --> 00:12:29,263
我对你的头衔没有争议 只是对你的角色有疑问 好吧
I wouldn't dispute your title. I might question your role.

293
00:12:29,298 --> 00:12:31,900
要是你能在副总统进房间的时候站起来那就太好了
It would be great if you would stand up when the vice president enters a room.

294
00:12:31,934 --> 00:12:34,636
哦 上帝啊 好吧 哦 上帝
- Oh, Lord, all right. - Oh, Lord.

295
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,504
这就好了 哦 放轻松 Kent
- There you go. - Oh, at ease, Kent.

296
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:38,373
我只是在找我的马克杯
I'm just looking for my mug.

297
00:12:38,408 --> 00:12:40,376
是的 我喜欢这个宝贝
Yeah. I love this baby.

298
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,544
它能盛九杯咖啡 哦 哇哦
- It holds about nine cups' worth. - Oh, wow.

299
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:44,880
是的 如果起火了 这是我唯一会带走的东西
Yeah, it's the only thing I'd save if this building were on fire.

300
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:48,550
好吧 这真是段愚蠢的对话
Okay. This is such a silly conversation that we're having.

301
00:12:48,584 --> 00:12:50,018
我正打算去和总统谈话
I'm gonna go talk to the president.

302
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,955
他睡了 他已经睡下了?
- He went to bed. - He's in bed?

303
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:55,257
那你就是哨兵了?
So that makes you the livewire, huh?

304
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,493
这个就没法结束 它不会结束
- This can't get out. - It won't get out.

305
00:12:57,527 --> 00:12:59,395
各位 总统已经睡了
Everyone, POTUS has gone to bed.

306
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,865
让我们为他的梦成真而奋斗到
So let's make sure we make his dreams come true tonight

307
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,934
弹尽粮绝吧
by fighting until that last bullet.

308
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:05,602
你为什么不用第一颗子弹
Why don't you take the first bullet

309
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:07,003
把自己的头打爆?
and put it through your brain?

310
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:09,873
是的 先生
Yes, sir. Pfft.

311
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:13,076
我将会在这里
I'm gonna have more of a role

312
00:13:13,144 --> 00:13:14,578
承担起更多的责任
in this administration.

313
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:16,179
哦 我刚处理了那些数字
Well, I just crunched the numbers.

314
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:17,614
我知道 你就是专门干那个的
I know. You're the numbers cruncher.

315
00:13:17,648 --> 00:13:19,616
现在它们一点味道都没了
And right now they taste pretty bland to me.

316
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,684
那么 加点调味料吧
Well, salt and pepper 'em.

317
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,324
Marion 你仔细听着
Marion, listen very closely.

318
00:13:27,358 --> 00:13:29,893
现在让副总统上你节目的难度
You have as much chance of getting the vice president on your show

319
00:13:29,928 --> 00:13:32,229
和让你丈夫离开那个拉拉队员差不多
as you have of getting your husband to leave that cheerleader.

320
00:13:32,263 --> 00:13:35,565
是的 Marion 我们都知道了 再见
Yes, Marion. We're all aware of that. Good-bye.

321
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,167
非常脆弱 他们是这么说的?
Touch and go? Is that what they said?

322
00:13:37,201 --> 00:13:40,537
不 那可是经典之作 上面还有专门放鱼叉的架子呢
No, it's a classic. There's a mounting on it for a harpoon gun.

323
00:13:40,605 --> 00:13:42,840
Richard 我说了不就是不
Well, Richard, if you hear me say no, that means no.

324
00:13:42,874 --> 00:13:44,107
不
No.

325
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:45,642
你很擅长打那些记者的脸哈
You good slapping down those hacks?

326
00:13:45,677 --> 00:13:47,110
我确实蛮享受的
I really do enjoy it.

327
00:13:47,145 --> 00:13:49,246
感觉就像一气甩了我所有的前男友
It's kind of like dumping all my ex-boyfriends at once.

328
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,814
你前男友很多哈?
Oh, you got a lot of exes, huh?

329
00:13:52,517 --> 00:13:54,651
嘿 宝贝 是Gary
Hey, dumpling. It's Gary.

330
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,319
不好意思没接到你的电话
I'm sorry I missed you.

331
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,621
只是我没找到她的口红而已
It's just I can't find her lipstick

332
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,290
我觉得有可能是从家里的Leviathan像里面掉出来了 (一种传说中的海怪)
and I thought maybe it fell out of the Leviathan at home.

333
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:05,128
同志们 Kent Davison回来了
Okay, folks, Kent Davison is back.

334
00:14:05,162 --> 00:14:08,331
第一 我们要怎么办?
what are we gonna do about it?

335
00:14:08,366 --> 00:14:10,500
第二 为什么是我在通知你们这件事?
Number two: why am I telling you this news?

336
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:12,669
第三 能不能请你他妈的把电话挂了
<i>And number three: would you please hang up the phone</i>

337
00:14:12,703 --> 00:14:15,238
因为老娘是美利坚副总统
because I'm the fucking Vice President of the United States

338
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:17,107
老娘有话要说 我挂了
- and I have something to say. - I'm going.

339
00:14:17,142 --> 00:14:19,676
我们现在需要想办法 这件事上把Kent拉到我们这边来
So now we got to figure out a way to get Kent on board

340
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,644
共同面对危机
with this whole co-POTAL thing.

341
00:14:21,712 --> 00:14:23,479
跟他讲道理是讲不通的 就像跟
You can't reason with him. It'd be like explaining

342
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,481
科莫多巨蜥解释什么是Supertramp乐队一样
Supertramp to a Komodo dragon.

343
00:14:25,516 --> 00:14:27,650
我不明白你说的是什么话
<i>na: I don't know what those words mean.</i>

344
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:29,752
Mike 你是不是正在发作动脉瘤什么的?
Mike, are you in the middle of some sort of aneurysm?

345
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:32,422
我们往回倒一下 好么? 好的
- Let's just wind back a sec, okay? - Yes.

346
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:34,791
你觉得Kent Davison不是好事?
You think Kent Davison is a bad thing?

347
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:37,561
好了
Okay. All right.

348
00:14:37,595 --> 00:14:40,164
我强烈感觉
I have a very strong feeling

349
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:43,034
Kent会在我和总统之间造成隔膜
that Kent is gonna get in between me and POTUS,

350
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:45,303
就像是很厚的套套一样
like some sort of thick rubber condom,

351
00:14:45,338 --> 00:14:48,073
而我必须要... 直通
And I have got to have... - Unprotected.

352
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:50,408
直通总统办公室
Unprotected access to the Oval Office.

353
00:14:50,476 --> 00:14:53,445
嗯 Amy 你和他一起跑过竞选
Well, Amy, you were on the campaign trail with him.

354
00:14:53,479 --> 00:14:55,681
我们应该怎么对付他? 呃 我 啊...
- How do we pop him? - Uh, I, um...

355
00:14:55,715 --> 00:14:58,250
我猜... 啥?
- Well, I guess... - What?

356
00:14:59,852 --> 00:15:01,486
嘿 是
Hey. Yeah. - Yeah? Yeah?

357
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,154
嗯? 嗯?
You have to go and see your dad.

358
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:05,189
你得去看你爸 呃 这可是中期选举
This is the midterms.

好了 各位 正式结果出来了

所以把所有的东西都放上车
So put everything on the wagons

366
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:24,609
把狗都毙了 因为我们刚他妈的丢了国会多数

367
00:15:24,643 --> 00:15:26,577

我觉得就是这样了 我觉得这是我们大显身手的机会
I think this is it. I think this is our time to strike.

370
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:33,351
好吧 计划是这样 我先去尿个尿
Okay, here's the plan. I'm gonna go pee pee

371
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,954
然后我们就把Kent灭了
and then we're gonna neutralize Kent.

372
00:15:36,021 --> 00:15:37,522

我只是想就您竞选州长失利
I just want to offer my sincere condolences

383
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:04,416

你要知道 我们现在失去了国会多数...
You know, now that we lost the House...

387
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:13,759
我们丢了国会你还在得意?
We just lost the House and you're crowing?

388
00:16:13,793 --> 00:16:15,594
你为这个感到高兴么?
You're actually pleased about this?

389
00:16:15,628 --> 00:16:18,130
为什么? 因为...我们丢了国会显然不是好事
Why? Because... well, we lost the House, that's bad, obviously,

390
00:16:18,165 --> 00:16:19,899
但这样你就不用伺候我了 而这就好了?
but now this gets me off your case and that's okay?

391
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:22,302
我都没您说得清楚 先生
Couldn't have put that better myself, sir.

392
00:16:23,204 --> 00:16:25,872
你是在吃我的批萨么?
Are you eating my pizza?

393
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:28,207
没有 先生 您...因为您刚才说...
No, sir, you... because you said that...

394
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:29,742
不 我说的是别在我面前晃
No, I said don't wave it in my face.

395
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:31,311
可没说让你吃 现在还能吃
- I didn't say eat it. - It's still good.

396
00:16:31,345 --> 00:16:33,346
吃了它 马上吃光! 对不起

很高兴你能百忙之中来看老爸
Just really glad you could fit your father into your busy schedule.

399

她就是问句好 亲爱的
She means hi, honey.

400
00:16:40,487 --> 00:16:42,889
Uh...

401
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,725
为什么他的心脏监视器没有亮?
Why is this heart monitor not on?

402
00:16:44,859 --> 00:16:45,877
我没事
I'm fine.

403
00:16:45,987 --> 00:16:47,809
他们不知道这是不是中风
They don't know if it was a stroke or not, hon.

404
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,665
好吧
Okay.

405
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,633
你说的是爸爸要临终了
You said Dad was dying.

406
00:16:54,668 --> 00:16:56,535
对不起让你失望了 Amy
Well, I'm so sorry to disappoint you, Amy.

407
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,304
大喊大叫可没什么好处
All the shouting certainly isn't helping anything.

408
00:16:58,338 --> 00:16:59,738
是啊 别喊了 Sophie
Yeah, stop shouting, Sophie.

409
00:16:59,772 --> 00:17:01,640
我的天 Amy 你只是为副总统工作而已
Oh, my God, Amy. You work for the vice president.

410
00:17:01,674 --> 00:17:03,074
又不是谷歌什么之类
It's not like it's Google.

411
00:17:03,109 --> 00:17:05,877
Dan 什么?
Dan. - Yeah?

412
00:17:05,912 --> 00:17:08,113

Let's go through here.

416
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,688

Whoa. - Sorry to disturb.

418
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,826
不知道你们在做什么 不过我会让你们接着做的
Don't know what you're doing, but I will leave you to it.

419
00:17:19,897 --> 00:17:20,995

你找到我的手下了 这是Jonah之队
I see you've found my crib. This is Team Jonah.

421
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:26,699
这是我的火热统计三件套 我的数据之源
This is my hot stat three-piece, my data Nirvana.

422

424
00:17:31,605 --> 00:17:34,541
所做的一切感到非常感激
on this terribly depressing evening.

425
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:36,142
对您来说并不糟糕
Actually, not terrible for you.

426
00:17:36,177 --> 00:17:39,513
您的助选总是让候选人们的支持率猛增
Your campaign visits always lead to a bump for the candidate.

427
00:17:39,547 --> 00:17:42,249
什么? 您表现一直在水准之上
What? - you have been a consistent integer.

428
00:17:42,283 --> 00:17:46,087
我不太确定我还记不记得什么叫水准
I'm not really sure I remember what an integer is, per se.

429
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:48,155
您就是好消息 您的表现都超过了总统

457
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:52,085
但是我想Dana拿了Selina的口红
but I think Dana took Selina's lipstick.

458
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:53,887
这是Selina唯一开口要的东西
It's the one thing Selina asked for

Always with the last word. That's why you're single. Guys hate that.

也许你最后一句话应该说不

468
00:19:20,114 --> 00:19:21,714
Kent.

469
00:19:23,283 --> 00:19:24,684

483

的地位要比副总统还高么?

484
00:19:59,978 --> 00:20:01,878
这就要看副总统的了 是么?
It depends on The Vice President. - Yeah?

485

487
00:20:06,984 --> 00:20:08,852
你只不过是一个附属的民选代表
You're only an elected representative by default.

488

你觉得你有什么资本来谈?
What leverage do you think that you have?

494

我来的时候带了一大袋资本呢
I got a big bag of leverage coming my way.

少来了 你是副总统
Come on, you are the vice president.

从定义上来说 你就比总统矮半截
By definition, you should be at half the height of the president.

499
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,045

这连百分之一都没有...
even a percent-age.

513
00:21:09,447 --> 00:21:11,681
不过要是四舍五入的话 可以算成一个点的
If we round it up, we can make it one.

514
00:21:11,716 --> 00:21:12,983

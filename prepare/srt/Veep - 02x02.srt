曾经被不少人爱过 他们都为她付了钱
it's been previously loved and paid for by a couple of guys.

28

你以前酗过酒?
You had a drinking problem?

33
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:35,107
没有那么严重 只是有点小瘾 都不算是酒瘾

34
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:37,276
都不算是酒瘾 就是有一段很爱喝
Not even an issue. A hitch.

38
00:01:43,384 --> 00:01:45,920
所以呢 我接受我不能改变的东西
So, I've accepted what I cannot change.

39
00:01:45,954 --> 00:01:47,722

00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:56,419
是啊 我永远都着眼长远目标
Yeah, well, I'm all about the long-term goals.

141
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,493
Mike 看这个
Mike, look at this.

142
00:06:05,129 --> 00:06:06,996
看这个 Mike
Look at this, Mike.

143
00:06:09,366 --> 00:06:11,000
我在空军二号喝咖啡哟
Just sipping some coffee. Air Force Two.

144
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:14,037
非常好 帮我照张望向窗外的照片
Real good. Take a picture of me looking out the window.

145
00:06:14,071 --> 00:06:15,605
Jonah Jonah 你冷静
Jonah. Jonah, calm down.

146
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:18,141
这只是一架带标致的飞机而已 又不是星际过山车 (迪士尼乐园项目)
It's a plane with a logo. It's not Space Mountain.

147
00:06:18,175 --> 00:06:21,044
你要是上了空军一号怎么办? 在座位上打飞机么?
What the hell do you do on Air Force One, rub your dick on the seats?

148
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:24,582
我还没有上过空军一号
I haven't actually been on Air Force One.

149
00:06:24,616 --> 00:06:26,017
啥? 我还没有...
- What? - I haven't been--

150
00:06:26,051 --> 00:06:27,918
<i>Oh!</i>

151
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:29,887
女士 呃
- Ma'am. - Ugh.

152
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:33,390
你怎么样 Mike? 挺好的 女士
- How you doing, Mike? - I'm doing great, ma'am.

153
00:06:33,424 --> 00:06:35,659
听说你的财政情况了
Heard about your financial situation.

154
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,427
船什么的
You know, the boat and everything.

155
00:06:37,495 --> 00:06:38,728
没事的
It's fine.

156
00:06:38,763 --> 00:06:40,563
我已经改换了我唯一能改变的东西
I've changed the only thing I can--

157
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:42,098
我对事物的反应
my reaction to things.

158
00:06:42,132 --> 00:06:44,366
噢 希望你偶尔也改换一下你的内裤
Oh. And your boxers occasionally, I hope.

159
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:45,734
我现在每天换一条
I have a fresh pair every day now.

160
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:47,269
噢 不错不错 Mike
Oh, good for you, Mike.

161
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:49,872
女士?
Hey, ma'am?

162
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:51,641
什么 Gary? 出什么事了?
What, Gary? What's wrong?

163
00:06:51,675 --> 00:06:54,176
我知道你觉得我这人大惊小怪 女士
I know you think I'm melodramatic, ma'am.

164
00:06:54,211 --> 00:06:56,045
我知道你就是大惊小怪
I know you're melodramatic.

165
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:58,781
我们刚玩完了
Uh-huh. Our world has just ended.

166
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,090
Mike!

167
00:07:07,926 --> 00:07:09,794
看这个
Read this.

168
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,863
这是什么?
What is this?

169
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,968
揭秘: Selina的小暗号
Selina's secret stash of signals.</i>

170
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:20,137
当副总统揉自己的右耳时 她的助手
When the VP rubs her right ear, an aide will tell her

171
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:22,173
就会告诉她必须要接紧急电话
she has an important call that she must take.

172
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:25,076
在不愿谈话的时候 这是她的抽身之策
In an unwanted conversation, this is her exit strategy.

173
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:28,846
好吧 现在有人维基解密了暗号
All right, well, somebody WikiLeaked the code.

174
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,248
我们不能再用这些了 我们需要新的暗号
So we can't use those. We need new signals.

175
00:07:31,282 --> 00:07:32,816
那些暗号是花了好久才摸索出来的
Those signals took years.

176
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,585
我不能把秘笈撕了
I can't just tear up the gestictionary

177
00:07:34,619 --> 00:07:36,320
然后瞬间发明一套新暗号
and come up with new codes like that.

178
00:07:36,354 --> 00:07:38,322
好吧 这个就可以做一个暗号 类似静音什么的
Okay, that could be a signal. Kind of a silent click.

179
00:07:38,356 --> 00:07:39,957
你能不能...好么 你就...
Would you please-- okay, could you just--

180
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,438
我只是需要一些最基本的暗号应付今天
I just need something basic for today.

181
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:43,527
我不想困在那跟那些
I don't want to get stuck talking pig shit

182
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,428
把干草垛当家具的人谈论什么猪的破事
with people who use hay as furniture.

183
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:47,464
我需要一个
<i>I need an exit strategy</i>

184
00:07:47,498 --> 00:07:49,432
能让我4:30回华盛顿 的抽身计策 赶紧给我想
to be in DC by 4:30, so start thinking.

185
00:07:49,467 --> 00:07:51,668
好吧 但是这些新暗号必须要隐蔽
Okay, but we have to make these new signals subtle

186
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:54,437
要看起来不像是在打暗号
so they don't kind of look like signals.

187
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:56,506
你明白就是这样
You do realize that that was the point

188
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,376
以前才要有暗号的吧? Mike 我意识到了
- of the old signals, right, Mike? - I realize that.

189
00:07:59,411 --> 00:08:01,212
噢! 你可以拍手
Oh! You slap your hands together.

190
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,847
然后竖起大拇指
Kind of give it a little thumbs up.

191
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,315
不行 这个就像是我拍死了一只虫子然后说
No, that's like I squished a bug

192
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,117
我拍死了只虫子真酷!
and then I said, Oh, it's so cool I squished a bug.

193
00:08:06,151 --> 00:08:08,820
那你拿着电话挠头呢?
What if you scratched your head with your phone in your hand?

194
00:08:08,855 --> 00:08:11,056
这个怎么样?
What about this?

195
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,524
哦 不行...
<i>Oh. No...</i>

196
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,659
这样看着不好看 噢 那算了
- You don't look pretty. - Oh, forget it.

197
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,261
我想到了 你可以揉眉毛
I got it. You can rub your eyebrow.

198
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:17,962
不会有人注意到的 很隐蔽
No one will see that. It's subtle.

199
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,230
很自然
<i>It looks natural.</i>

200
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:21,232
那如果别人觉得我眉毛长阴虱了呢?
What if people think I have crabs in my eyebrows?

201
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:23,701
眉毛怎么能长阴虱呢?
How can you have crabs in your eyebrow?

202
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,570
好吧 Gary 当一对男女非常相爱
Okay, Gary, when a man and a woman

203
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:28,173
又是这个男人生日的时候...
love each other very much and it's the man's birthday--

204
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:30,776
出事了 什么?
<i>- Crap in a hat.</i> - What?

205
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,044
是你女儿 什么? 出什么事了?
- It's your daughter. - What? What is it?

206
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:36,381
她没事 不过她干了一些会让你想杀了的事
She's fine, but she's done something that'll make you want to kill her.

207
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,452
天哪 到处都是了
Christ, it's everywhere.

208
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,588
如果只是篇电影论文的话...
Well, if it's just a film studies essay--

209
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,491
不 Catherine的论文是写
No, Catherine's essay is about

210
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:47,027
Emad Burnat的 5台破相机的
Emad Burnat's movie 5 Broken Cameras.

211
00:08:47,061 --> 00:08:48,728
如果没有Owen Wilson演出的话 我可能就不知道这片
If Owen Wilson's not in it, I probably don't know it.

212
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,797
这是一部关于巴勒斯坦人非暴力抵抗
It's about nonviolent Palestinian resistance

213
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:52,465
以色列人在(约旦河)西岸建立定居点的电影
to Israeli settlement on the West Bank.

214
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,067
这听起来不像是Owen的片子
That doesn't sound like one of Owen's.

215
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,535
她在文中说这是对以色列
She talks about the masterly portrayal

216
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:58,071
野蛮非法入侵的精湛写照
of brutal, illegal Israeli aggression.

217
00:08:58,105 --> 00:09:00,874
哎呀 我们必须发布声明
Ouch. - We have to issue a statement.

218
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:03,576
好的 声明要用标准的挺以色列
All right, well, standard issue pro-Israeli,

219
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,312
也挺巴勒斯坦的口气 但要稍微偏向以色列一点点
pro-Palestinian, but subtly more pro-Israeli statement.

220
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:07,980
你就按F9把这破玩意打印出来就完了
I mean, hit F9 and print that fucker out.

221
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:09,582
不 这必须好好写
No, this needs to be top-notch.

222
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:10,883
这必须是滴水不漏
This needs to be the Gettysburg Address

223
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,785
毫无破绽 说了当没说的东西
of tightrope-walking, say-nothing bullshit.

224
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,954
我大显身手的时候到了
My time has come.

225
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:19,058
好吧 这样我们下次选举就输掉佛罗里达好了 (退休犹太人的天堂)
All right, well, next election I guess we lose Florida, then.

226
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:20,659
我们15分钟后着陆
We got wheels down in 15.

227
00:09:20,694 --> 00:09:21,854
好吧 我得换衣服了
All right, I've got to change.

228
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:22,961
好吧 我给Amy发短信
All right, I'll text Amy.

229
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,130
Gary 我今天要穿什么?
Gary, what am I supposed to wear today?

230
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,032
至少这个没问题
At least that's good.

231
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,267
大家好呀
Well, howdy, y'all.

232
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,001
我的天哪 看看这里
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i> <i>Look at this.</i>

233
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:32,937
走得透 聊着肉
Walking the walk, talking the pork.

234
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:35,339
看看你 拿着棉花糖的成年女人
Look at you, a grown woman with cotton candy.

235
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:37,774
像你的脸一样粉嘟嘟的 你们两个我都要抱一下
Pink like your cheeks. I'm gonna give you both a hug.

236
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:40,276
天哪 这看起来好吃得要舔手指了
Oh, gosh, that looks like finger-licking fun.

237
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:42,512
这是我今天刚想到的说法哦 你们喜欢吗?
That's a term I just coined today. Do you like it?

238
00:09:42,546 --> 00:09:44,781
每个人都过得很高兴 但是这位小伙子
Everybody's having such a good time. But this young man

239
00:09:44,815 --> 00:09:47,049
怎么没有东西吃呢? 为什么呀?
doesn't have anything to eat. Now why would that be?

240
00:09:47,084 --> 00:09:49,584
我希望你不要饿死了哟 甜心
I hope you're not just starving to death, sweetheart.

241
00:09:49,619 --> 00:09:51,860
出什么事了? 我们应该让你多长点肉才行哦
What's going on? We've got to get some meat on your bones.

242
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:53,588
这样就好了
And there you go.

243
00:09:53,622 --> 00:09:55,689
你一开口就能实现
Ask and you shall receive.

244
00:09:55,724 --> 00:09:58,292
为什么只有我一个人带着牛仔帽?
Why am I the only one wearing a cowboy hat?

245
00:09:58,326 --> 00:09:59,993
我要摘了这顶帽子
I'm gonna take this hat off.

246
00:10:00,028 --> 00:10:01,795
不行 头发被帽子压过了 千万不要
No. Hat hair, hat hair. Please don't.

247
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:04,363
是的 她在肉前面表现得很好 先生
Yes, she's pressing the flesh very well, sir.

248
00:10:04,398 --> 00:10:07,233
而这帮人有很多很多肉
And these people have a lot of flesh.

249
00:10:07,267 --> 00:10:08,767
政治上两个要绕着走的事:
Two things in politics to avoid--

250
00:10:08,801 --> 00:10:11,036
中东问题 还有家庭争吵 现在我们这是二合一了?
Middle East and family strife. And we're combining both?

251
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,438
你得让他女儿道歉
<i>Now you get the daughter</i> <i>to apologize.</i>

252
00:10:13,472 --> 00:10:15,106
你有我的授权
You have my authority.

253
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,608
也就是说你有总统的授权
Ergo, you have POTUS's authority.

254
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:19,343
明白了么? 是的 先生
- <i>Understood?</i> - Yes, sir.

255
00:10:19,377 --> 00:10:21,578
如果现在是60年代的话
If this were the '60s,

256
00:10:21,613 --> 00:10:23,981
我们可以直接派国民警卫队把她女儿干掉
we could just have the National Guard shoot the daughter.

257
00:10:24,015 --> 00:10:25,950
白宫的 白宫的 让一让 借过
West Wing, West Wing. Pardon me. Coming through.

258
00:10:25,984 --> 00:10:28,552
噢 你好 不好意思 白宫的 过一下
- Oh, hi there. - Pardon me, West Wing. Pardon me. Excuse me.

259
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:30,922
你好 小姑娘 我是总统办公室的
Oh, hello, little girl. Office of the president.

260
00:10:30,956 --> 00:10:33,224
请站开 谢谢
Please step off to the side. Thank you.

261
00:10:33,259 --> 00:10:36,494
女士 我接到授权通知您
Ma'am, I have been charged with informing you

262
00:10:36,529 --> 00:10:38,797
您必须让您的女儿Catherine

263
00:10:38,831 --> 00:10:42,334
立即明确的道歉
to apologize unequivocally and immediately.

264
00:10:42,368 --> 00:10:45,604
是么? 你去死吧 竹竿
Yeah? Well, go shit yourself, Long Tall Sally,

265
00:10:45,638 --> 00:10:47,706
我会按我自己的时间
because I will deal with my daughter

266
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,675
用我自己的方式来管我女儿
in my own way on my own terms.

267
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,144
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

268
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:54,479
噢 这是你妈 嘿 你接通她了?

269
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,748
嗨 Catherine 你好吗?
Hi, Catherine. How are you?

270
00:10:56,782 --> 00:10:59,917
妈妈好 住手 住手 你吓到我了
- Hi, Mom. - Stop it. Stop it. You're freaking me out.

271
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:01,752
住手 吓到你了?
stop it. - Freaking you out?

272
00:11:01,819 --> 00:11:03,453
不 亲爱的 不是你  Catherine
No, honey. Not you, Catherine.

273
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:06,356
是Mike 他把你放在了他身上
It was Mike. He had you on top of his body.

274
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,591
不 这个说法不对劲
No, that came out wrong.

275
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:10,460
听着 你过得怎么样? 我挺好
- Listen, how are you doing? - I'm okay.

276
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,362
我受到了很多人注意
I'm getting a lot of attention.

277
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:14,497
是的 你为什么要戴牛仔帽啊?
Yeah. - Why are you wearing a cowboy hat?

278
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,366
我在出席一个肉类活动
I'm at a pork event.

279
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,535
听着 你不能跟任何人说这篇论文的事
Listen, you can't talk to anybody about this essay.

280
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:21,404
媒体 记者什么的都不行
No media, no journalists or anything.

281
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,272
有人在你那边么 亲爱的? 是谁?

是的 是我男朋友
Yeah, actually, it's my boyfriend.

283
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:30,113
开玩笑吧 真让人激动
You're kidding. That's exciting.

284
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,515
他叫Rahim 他是Dilka的弟弟
His name is Rahim. He's Dilka's brother.

285
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:34,383
Dilka的弟弟?
Dilka's brother?

286
00:11:34,418 --> 00:11:36,585
什么? 你觉得他是伊朗人有问题么?
What? Do you have a problem with him being Iranian?

287
00:11:36,653 --> 00:11:38,354
好吧 Catherine
Okay, Catherine, you know

288
00:11:38,388 --> 00:11:40,990
你知道我不是种族主义者
that I am not a racist, okay?

289
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:43,493
我大学的男朋友有四分之一Cherokee血统呢 (北美原住民的一支)
My boyfriend in college was a quarter Cherokee.

290
00:11:43,527 --> 00:11:46,663
妈妈 很对不起 但是我不会道歉的
Mom, I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna say sorry.

291
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:48,664
好吗? 不 Cath...
- <i>Okay?</i> - No, Cath--

292
00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:50,199
Catherine 别...好吧
Catherine, don't-- all right.

293
00:11:50,234 --> 00:11:52,635
好吧 真顺利 和Catherine聊得不错?
- Well, that worked perfectly. - Good talk with Catherine?

294
00:11:52,669 --> 00:11:55,238
这个嘛 我们有比这个聊得好的时候
Well, we've had happier conversations.

295
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,006
比方说我告诉她她外公去世了的那次
Like when I told her her grandpa had died.

296
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,474
噢 她不喜欢他吧?
Oh, she didn't like him, huh?

297
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,209
不 我说的不是这个意思
No, that's not what I meant.

298
00:12:00,243 --> 00:12:02,645
噢 对不起 只是我外公 他真是个变态...
Oh, sorry. It's just my grampy, he was a real prick.

299
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,380
好了 Mike 我是说他...
- Okay, Mike. - I mean he was--

300
00:12:04,414 --> 00:12:05,915
你得去弄架直升机
You need to get a chopper.

301
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,316
我要你去Catherine的学校
I want you to go to Catherine's college.

302
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,286
不 你接上她 然后把她带到空军基地
No. You pick her up, bring her to the air base. All right?

303
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,388
弄点毛巾 我可能要对她管教管教
Get some towels. I may need to daughter board her.

304
00:12:12,422 --> 00:12:14,523
好么?
Okay?

305
00:12:14,558 --> 00:12:17,426
你讨厌直升机 Mike 我知道
- You hate choppers, Mike. - I know.

306
00:12:17,461 --> 00:12:19,695
我总是害怕把我脑袋削掉了
I'm always afraid I'm gonna get my head cut off.

307
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,497
是啊 有这种事
Yeah, it happens.

308
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:30,307
当以色列军队没有占领...
While Israel's military non-occupation--

309
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,775
不 不 在场
No, no, presence.

310
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,044
当以色列军队在场时 如何如何如何
While Israel's military presence-- words, words, words.

311
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:37,014
噢 扮高兴这个事太他妈累人了
Oh, this whole being pleasant is fucking exhausting.

312
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,482
是的 先生 非常累人
Yes, sir. It's very tiring.

313
00:12:38,516 --> 00:12:40,617
我对这些烂人们已经说不动好话了
I'm running out of nice juice to spray at these shit munchers.

314
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:42,085
你好啊 见到你很高兴
Hi there. Good to see you.

315
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:45,155
我们同时也希望能让巴勒斯坦人能建立起家园
We also desire a settled homeland for the Palestinian people.

316
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,391
看看是谁啊
<i>Oh, look who we have here.</i>

317
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:50,060
不光是大美女 还有大美女哦
Not only Ginger Rogers, but also Ginger Rogers.

318
00:12:50,094 --> 00:12:51,628
这个梗堆得好 先生
Nice joke construction, sir.

319
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:54,431
不要拍我的马屁了 你个四眼废柴
Stop trying to polish my dick, you fucking four-eyed failure.

320
00:12:54,465 --> 00:12:56,166
好吧 然后...
- Okay. - And--

321
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,203
朋友们好啊 我们正好在楼里 就顺道过来了
Greetings, friends. We were just in the building, so we stopped by.

322
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,973
在楼里? 好吧 你们今天是来擦窗户的么?
In the building? Okay. What, are you guys washing the windows today?

323
00:13:02,007 --> 00:13:04,042
还是来打扫卫生间? 你真是聪明啊 Dan
- Working on the bathrooms? - You're quite the wit, Dan.

324
00:13:04,076 --> 00:13:05,643
是的 我是聪明 而你就是...
Yeah, I am quite the wit. And you're quite--

325
00:13:05,678 --> 00:13:07,045
我们正要去医院
<i>We were just heading</i> <i>to the hospital.</i>

326
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:10,348
我父亲的呼吸现在很糟糕了
My father's breathing has become very bad.

327
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:12,617
他们觉得他可能过不了今晚
They think he might not last through the night.

328
00:13:12,651 --> 00:13:16,587
而Dan要跟我一起去好接着起草声明
And Dan needs to come with me so we can continue the statement.

329
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:18,823
很抱歉 噢 完全没有的事 你爸的事我很遗憾
- Apologies. - Oh, no, not at all. I'm sorry about your dad.

330
00:13:18,857 --> 00:13:20,758
好了 我们该走了 那下次再谈
- Okay, we should be going. - We'll talk another time, then.

331
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:22,293
我有的是时间
I got all the time in the world.

332
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:24,562
事实上我们必须在明天之前离开特区
We do actually have to be out of DC by tomorrow.

333
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,198
那只是个暗喻 严格意义上来说 我不觉得那算是 先生
- It's a metaphor. - I don't think it strictly is, sir.

334
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,766
从打比方的角度来说
As a figure of speech--

335
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:30,969
你就像一只充满火蚁的安全套一样令人讨厌
You know, you're about as annoying as a condom filled with fire ants.

336
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:32,537
这个他妈的暗喻怎么样?
How's that for a fucking metaphor?

337
00:13:32,571 --> 00:13:34,305
那是个明喻 先生 闭上你的嘴 肥妞
- That's a simile, sir. - Shut your mouth, you fat girl.

338
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:40,044
那么你爸爸在哪个医院?
So what hospital is your dad in?

339
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,779
乔治·华盛顿医院
George Washington.

340
00:13:41,814 --> 00:13:43,581
哦 那是个好医院
Oh, that's a good one.

341
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:48,452
那有个很大的星巴克
They got a big Starbucks there.

342
00:13:48,487 --> 00:13:50,454
很不错 你知道的 去那的人们不...
It's nice. You know, people go in there that aren't--

343
00:13:50,488 --> 00:13:52,689
你可以不用说话 谢谢
- You don't have to speak. - Thank you.

344
00:13:52,724 --> 00:13:55,258
给你 女士 你尝尝
There you go, ma'am. You taste that.

345
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,973
那里就是天堂 这真大
- That's heaven right there. - This is big.

346
00:13:56,994 --> 00:13:58,227
但我确信我能吃完
But I bet I can finish it.

347
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:00,463
我要四号洲际公路选区大胜 (摇摆选区 必争之地)
<i>I want to smash the I-4 corridor--</i>

348
00:14:00,531 --> 00:14:03,966
我是说要完全的大胜 要全程专注在党内选举上
and I mean smash it-- all the while focusing on the inside game.

349
00:14:04,001 --> 00:14:07,069
然后我们...我嘞个去
Then what-- holy cow.

350
00:14:07,104 --> 00:14:09,138
一头猪
<i>A pig.</i>

351
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:12,041
这不是在直升机里
<i>It's not being in the helicopter.</i>

352
00:14:12,075 --> 00:14:14,210
没关系 我可以乘直升机
<i>That's fine. I can ride in a helicopter.</i>

353
00:14:14,245 --> 00:14:17,147
还只是刚刚进去而已 我就担心它会颠簸
It's just getting in. I'm afraid it's gonna wobble.

354
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:19,082
就像 你懂的 它就会把我的头
Like, you know, it'd chop the top of my head off

355
00:14:19,117 --> 00:14:20,817
就像溏心蛋一样削下来  然后我就...
like a soft-boiled egg and then I'm, like,

356
00:14:20,852 --> 00:14:22,753
会到处跑 试图把我的头放回去
running around trying to put my head back on.

357
00:14:22,787 --> 00:14:26,022
这真疯狂 Mike 我只是写了篇影评
This is crazy, Mike. All I did was write a review of a movie.

358
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:30,193
我知道 Catherine 但是所有关于中东的事情都很糊涂
I know, Catherine, but the whole Middle East thing is very confusing.

359
00:14:30,227 --> 00:14:31,762
对吗 Rahim?
Right, Rahim?

360
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:33,964
不 有时它对我来说是再清晰不过了
No, sometimes it can seem pretty clear-cut to me.

361
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:37,568
嗯 好吧 抱歉
Yeah, well-- excuse me.

362
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:39,403
Mike 你在哪? -
Mike, where are you?

363
00:14:39,438 --> 00:14:41,805
我在烤猪的地方
I'm at the hog roast.

364
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,974
你是不是因为大脑萎缩而瘫痪了?
And are you paralyzed from the neck down?

365
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:47,177
你为什么没有阻止这个? 阻止...
- Why aren't you stopping this? - Stopping...

366
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:49,680
这一任内阁的态度有改变吗?
Has the position of this administration changed

367
00:14:49,748 --> 00:14:52,050
对以色列和巴勒斯坦
toward Israel and Palestine?

368
00:14:52,084 --> 00:14:55,687
当然 我们是支持以色列的...
We support the state of Israel, of course...

369
00:14:55,722 --> 00:14:58,490
Mike 副总统正在谈团结
Mike, the VP is voicing solidarity

370
00:14:58,524 --> 00:15:02,094
旋转的烤猪前跟犹太人
with the Jewish people in front of rotating pork.

371
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:05,164
...为犹太人 改变那个画面
- ...for the Jewish people. - Change the visual.

372
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,500
把那个画面弄走 是的 先生
- Deport the visual. - Yes, sir.

373
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:09,769
J-1-1.

374
00:15:09,837 --> 00:15:11,604
你有什么Jonah紧急事件?
What's your Jonah emergency?

375
00:15:11,638 --> 00:15:13,806
Jonah 让副总统离开那只猪
Jonah, move the veep away from the pig.

376
00:15:13,841 --> 00:15:15,842
想想这里面的敏感性
<i>Think about</i> <i>the sensitivities here.</i>

377
00:15:15,876 --> 00:15:19,446
什么 猪? Mike 这个国家 绝大部分的犹太人都不会对猪太在意
What, pork? Mike, most Jews in this country are fine with pork.

378
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,914
他们常说猪没什么的
Pork schmork, they often say.

379
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:23,183
这个国家的大部分犹太人
Most Jews in this country

380
00:15:23,217 --> 00:15:25,819
都不会对猪太在意 Davison先生 猪肉没什么的 真的
are fine with pork, Mr. Davison. Pork schmork, really.

381
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:27,487
你听过旧约吗 Mike?
You ever hear of the Old Testament, Mike?

382
00:15:27,521 --> 00:15:29,089
以色列 欧洲
Israel, Europe.

383
00:15:29,123 --> 00:15:30,624
Jonah 以色列 欧洲
Jonah, Israel, Europe.

384
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,859
好吧 他妈的 好吧 Mike
Okay. Fuck. Fine, Mike.

385
00:15:32,893 --> 00:15:35,362
但你他妈的欠我个人情 抱歉
But you fucking owe me for this. Excuse me.

386
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:39,566
这些养猪的不会问Selina中东政治什么的 对吧?
These pork folks won't ask Selina about Middle East politics, right?

387
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,602
哦 不 那些傻瓜大概认为
Oh, no. Those fuckers probably think

388
00:15:41,669 --> 00:15:43,603
中东指的是堪萨斯吧
the Middle East means Kansas.

389
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:46,773
嘿 你知道吗? 我对疾病或者死亡
Hey, you know what? I'm not really great with illness

390
00:15:46,807 --> 00:15:49,743
还有基本的安慰什么都不太在行
or death or basic empathy,

391
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:51,444
但我想说 关于你爸爸我感到很抱歉
but I just want to say I'm sorry about your dad

392
00:15:51,478 --> 00:15:53,179
我认为你很勇敢
and I think you're being really brave.

393
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:54,680
什么?我们为什么停在这?
What? Why are we stopping here?

394
00:15:54,714 --> 00:15:56,282
那是我爸
That's my dad.

395
00:15:56,316 --> 00:15:58,450
天哪 他看起来可不像要死的样子
Jesus, he doesn't look like he's dying.

396
00:15:58,485 --> 00:16:00,652
我家里用罪恶感来绑住我
My family was guilt-tripping the shit out of me

397
00:16:00,686 --> 00:16:02,554
所以我把情况说夸张一点好来探访
and so I exaggerated to come visit.

398
00:16:02,588 --> 00:16:05,089
除此之外 一个临死的爸爸是张免死金牌
Besides, a dying dad can be a get-out-of-jail-free card.

399
00:16:05,124 --> 00:16:07,125
就像对Furlong的时候 喔
Like with Furlong. - Wow.

400
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,294
这真冷血
That is cold.

401
00:16:09,328 --> 00:16:11,362
但是也很热辣
Also kind of hot.

402
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:15,066
...作为犹太人的祖国
...and as a homeland for the Jewish people

403
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,035
同时 我们也认为
while at the same time we support

404
00:16:17,069 --> 00:16:19,137
巴勒斯坦人民需要一个稳定的家园
a settled homeland for the Palestinians.

405
00:16:19,204 --> 00:16:20,738
我仍能看见那头猪的屁股
I can still see the pig's ass.

406
00:16:20,773 --> 00:16:22,573
你没挡住 弯下身来
You're not blocking it. Bend down.

407
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,108
绑鞋带 随便什么
Tie your shoe, whatever.

408
00:16:24,143 --> 00:16:27,078
那是个很似是而非的话题
That's a circle that's tricky to square.

409
00:16:27,113 --> 00:16:28,947
总统和我…
And the president and I...

410
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:32,150
这种情形下我们很需要一个块头更大的人
We really need a bulkier man in this situation.

411
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:35,287
够了吗? 再靠近点
- Am I there? <i>- Get closer towards it.</i>

412
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:37,422
好吧 Mike 我已经紧挨着炭了
Okay, Mike, it's right next to the coals.

413
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:38,590
它们很烫
The coals are hot.

414
00:16:38,624 --> 00:16:41,026
嘿 别碰那只猪
Hey, quit touching the pig.

415
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,394
这可不是他妈的爱畜动物园
It's not a fucking petting zoo.

416
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:44,596
女士 这关系国家安全 成吗?
Ma'am, this is a matter of security, okay?

417
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,531
你觉得这只猪会袭击她?
You think this pig is gonna attack her?

418
00:16:46,565 --> 00:16:49,000
孩子那该死的已经被剥了皮 放在火上烤了
Son, that fucker is skinned and roasted.

419
00:16:49,034 --> 00:16:50,401
那是个巨大的劣势
He's at a huge disadvantage.

420
00:16:50,436 --> 00:16:53,238
好吧 瞧 总统办公室的 所以我呆定了
Okay, look, office of the president. So I'm staying.

421
00:16:53,305 --> 00:16:55,506
我不关心是不是要出丧而占用那条街道
I don't care if there is a funeral procession due to use that street.

422

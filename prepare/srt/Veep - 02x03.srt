1
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,085
你看了这个吗? 瞧瞧
Are you watching this? Look at this.

2
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:23,989
关于人质 肖恩·潘做得都比我们多 (著名硬汉影星)
Sean Penn is doing more about the hostages than we are.

3
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,726
这些可怜的孩子...他们和Caterine差不多大
These poor kids... they're like Catherine's age.

4
00:00:26,727 --> 00:00:30,531
我在人质危机中表现肯定会很糟 就算当劫匪也不会好
I'd be terrible in a hostage situation, even as a hostage taker.

5
00:00:30,532 --> 00:00:32,334
女士 国防部长那还没有任何
So, ma'am, no word yet from the Secretary of Defense

6
00:00:32,335 --> 00:00:33,802
关于和他一起去海军基地的答复吗
about joining him at the Marine base?

7
00:00:33,803 --> 00:00:35,370
唔 没有 Maddox什么都没说
Uh, no, nothing from Maddox,

8
00:00:35,371 --> 00:00:37,605
但他知道我现在在白宫的影响更大了
but he knows I've got a bigger role in the White House now,

9
00:00:37,606 --> 00:00:40,042
也就是说我有个更大的屌让他吸了
which means I've got a bigger dick, which means he can suck it.

10
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:42,279
那真令人高兴 我的演讲怎么样了?
I'm so happy about that. How's my speech coming?

11
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,315
哦 就一个小改动 就一个词 真的
Oh, one minor change. Just one word, really.

12
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:47,352
经过深思熟虑的答复将变成坚定的答复
Considered response is now gonna be robust response.

13
00:00:47,353 --> 00:00:49,354
坚定的? 见鬼 这真不错
Robust? Damn, that's good.

14
00:00:49,355 --> 00:00:52,325
嗯 我是说 它微妙得足够让我们向总统示忠
Yeah, I mean, it's subtle enough to seem loyal to POTUS.

15
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:55,195
那会让特区激动得过电的 哦 那会给特区通上交流电
- That's gonna electrify DC. - Oh, it's gonna AC DC.

16
00:00:55,196 --> 00:00:56,963
坚定是个好词
Robust is a good word.

17
00:00:56,964 --> 00:00:59,065
而且你不常听到 就像自以为是一样
And you don't hear it often, like bumptious.

18
00:00:59,066 --> 00:01:01,869
是的 它就是你想在人质危机时听到的
Yeah, it's what you want to hear in a hostage crisis.

19
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,405
坚定 不是自以为是
Robust, not bumptious.

20
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,107
Mike 你觉得怎么样? 坚定这个词怎么样?
Mike, what do you think? What do you think about robust?

21
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,576
坚定? 我喜欢 让我想到了酒 (robust也表示香味浓烈)
Robust? I like it. It makes me think of wine.

22
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:10,177
事实上我喜欢那样的红酒
It's actually how I like my reds.

23
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:12,279
你还喜欢用弯曲的吸管喝红酒 对吗 Mike
You like your reds through a bendy straw, too, right, Mike?

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,214
Mike 你身上有甜甜圈
You got donut on you, Mike.

25
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:15,983
Sue 祝你在听证会一切顺利
Sue, good luck at the hearing.

26
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,954
记住 Sue 要装傻 我会的
- Remember, Sue, be dull. - I will.

27
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,690
你是来开会的吗?我没约任何人
Are you here for a meeting? I'm not expecting anyone.

28
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,393
Sue 我是临时来顶你班的 Cliff Cliff 嘿 我是Gary
- Sue, I'm your fill-in, Cliff. - Cliff. Hey, I'm Gary.

29
00:01:25,394 --> 00:01:28,997
我是你的邻居 记住 照顾好Selina 好吗?
I'm your neighbor. Remember, take care of Selina, okay?

30
00:01:28,998 --> 00:01:31,233
VP代表很珍贵
VP stands for very precious.

31
00:01:31,234 --> 00:01:33,368
懂吗? 是的
Okay? - Okay.

32
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:34,436
Cliff 在
Cliff. - Yes.

33
00:01:34,437 --> 00:01:35,838
这是副总统百科全书
This is the Veeplopedia.

34
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:37,273
里面有一切你需要知道的东西
It's everything you'll ever need to know.

35
00:01:37,274 --> 00:01:40,076
喔 希望这个有随赠读书笔记 (类似教材参考书的东西)
Wow. Hope it comes with CliffsNotes.

36
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,815
那是个和我名字有关的文字游戏 我的名字是Cliff
That was a play on my name. My name is Cliff.

37
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,584
别开玩笑 Cliff
Don't do jokes, Cliff.

38
00:01:46,585 --> 00:01:48,752
我没有幽默感而你也不该有
I don't have a sense of humor and neither should you.

39
00:01:52,422 --> 00:01:53,704
早上好
Good morning.

40
00:01:53,705 --> 00:01:56,119
你怎么能把两个令人愉悦的词变得如此讨厌呢?
How do you make two perfectly pleasant words so irritating?

41
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,890
就是他 那个不给他的蛋做民调就
And here he is, the man who can't take a leak

42
00:01:57,891 --> 00:01:59,324
尿不出来的男人
without polling his balls.

43
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,593
把我的樱桃色活页文件夹拿来 Jonah
Bring me my cerise-colored binder, Jonah.

44
00:02:01,594 --> 00:02:04,326
樱桃色?是的 先生
Cerise? Yes, sir.

45
00:02:04,327 --> 00:02:06,191
副总统的基地访问就是今天
The VP's base visit today.

46
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,389
国防部长Maddox没有辜负他的名字
Secretary of Defense Maddox is living up to his name.

47
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,554
他气得跟公牛一样发狂
He's mad as an ox.

48
00:02:10,555 --> 00:02:12,717
我很确定只要我一到那就能阻止任何激烈的争辩
I'm sure I can break up any catfights when I get there.

49
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:15,349
副总统更关注人质的情况
The veep's more concerned with the hostage situation.

50
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,081
是的 我昨晚和总统谈过了
Yeah, I was talking to POTUS last night.

51
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:20,143
他都同意得那话儿站起来有Jonah那么高了
He had a pro-strike hawk boner the size of Jonah.

52
00:02:20,144 --> 00:02:22,240
而你今天早上和他谈话后
And then you talked to him about it this morning

53
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,975
他突然就很反对这项行动了
and he's suddenly totally against the operation.

54
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:27,110
我只是把民调结果给了总统而已
All I do is provide POTUS with the polls.

55
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,145
冰冷的数字 上帝 我恨数字
<i>- Cold numbers. - God, I hate numbers.</i>

56
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:32,048
很多文化甚至都没有数字 但他们过得很好
There's cultures that don't even have any numbers and they do just fine.

57
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:35,351
好吧 Ben 看上去你并不适合现在的工作 你该辞职
Well, Ben, it seems like you're ill-suited for your job and you should resign.

58
00:02:35,352 --> 00:02:37,919
把Ben的衰弱放一边 副总统觉得
Ben's breakdown aside, the VP feels we need

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,453
我们需要一次迅速的军事袭击
a quick military strike here.

60
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:42,219
是的 严格又精确 就像你的前脑叶白质切除术一样 Kent
Yeah, precise and surgical, like your lobotomy, Kent.

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,610
樱桃色活页夹 先生 不 这是桃红色
- The cerise binders, sir. - No, that's cherry red.

62
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:48,162
樱桃色 抱歉 先生
- Cerise. - I'm sorry, sir.

63
00:02:48,163 --> 00:02:50,590
我肯定有某种特殊的色盲
I must have a very specific form of color blindness.

64
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:52,653
我每天都做这种面
I cook these noodles every day.

65
00:02:52,654 --> 00:02:54,751
哦 面的比喻
Oh, the noodle analogy.

66
00:02:54,752 --> 00:02:56,484
你们会喜欢的
You guys are gonna love this.

67
00:02:58,084 --> 00:02:59,713
我马上离开
I will leave.

68
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:01,213
它们得在800瓦的功率下加热
They need to be heated at 800 watts

69
00:03:01,214 --> 00:03:02,745
3分35秒
for three minutes and 35 seconds.

70
00:03:02,746 --> 00:03:04,279
超过就会太干
Any more and they'll dry out.

71
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,545
时间少了它们就会软趴趴湿哒哒的
Any less and they will be flaccid and damp

72
00:03:06,546 --> 00:03:08,809
就像雨天里女人的头发一样
like a lady's hair in the rain.

73
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,041
我们为什么要谈论面条? 不 让我换个问法
- Why are we talking about noodles? - No, let me rephrase that.

74
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,973
我们他妈为什么要讨论面条?
Why the fuck are we talking about noodles?

75
00:03:12,974 --> 00:03:16,438
我会告诉你原因 人质危机 面条...一样的原则
I'll tell you why. Hostage crisis, noodles... same principle.

76
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,604
全都要求精确的时机把握 都不能匆忙处理
Both require precision timing, neither should be rushed.

77
00:03:19,605 --> 00:03:22,932
只有在65%以上的美国人支持不计伤亡
Inaction only becomes untenable when more than 65% of Americans

78
00:03:22,933 --> 00:03:25,564
采取干预措施的时候行动时机才成熟
support intervention even with casualties.

79
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,652
所以你想让我告诉副总统在那之前我们什么都不干?
So you'd like me to tell the vice president we do nothing until then?

80
00:03:28,653 --> 00:03:30,474
等待不是什么都不做
Waiting is not doing nothing.

81
00:03:30,475 --> 00:03:33,109
我选择等我的面条
I choose to wait for my noodles

82
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:35,542
就算我的唾液腺朝我大喊
even though my salivary glands are crying out to me

83
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:37,332
像新生的幼鸟一样
like newly hatched birds.

84
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:40,990
但它们会感谢我 因为我会一直等到...
But they will thank me because I waited until...

85
00:03:43,503 --> 00:03:48,283
你就为了等你这一叮
You just timed out that whole shit analogy

86
00:03:48,284 --> 00:03:50,128
把刚才的时间用狗屎比喻给糊过去了?
for your little ding?

87
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,407
真你妈可悲
That is fucking pathetic.

88
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,244
嘿 Maddox那有任何消息吗
Hey, have we heard anything from Maddox?

89
00:03:58,245 --> 00:04:00,624
他有因为我在基地出现而吐子弹么?
Is he spitting bullets 'cause I'm showing up at the base?

90
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,936
什么也没有 真的吗
Nothing. Nada. - Really?

91
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:04,415
那挺可怕 不是吗 是挺可怕
- It's eerie, right? - It is eerie.

92
00:04:06,062 --> 00:04:08,073
嘿 Neilio 我们进来了
Hey, Neilio. We're in.

93
00:04:08,074 --> 00:04:09,786
到里面见 我猜
<i>See you in there, I guess.</i>

94
00:04:09,787 --> 00:04:12,198
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

95
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:15,101
他的头大概塞进屁股里了
Probably got his head stuck in her ass.

96
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:17,669
是的 我有 哦 天哪 是的
Yes, I do. Oh, my gosh, yes.

97
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,149
嘿 女士 在Maddox到之前你有五分钟副总统的时间
Hey, ma'am, you've got five minutes of veep time before Maddox arrives.

98
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:21,760
是的 他们没有对你行礼
- Yeah. - They're not saluting you.

99
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,983
他们在室内不行礼 Gary
They don't salute indoors, Gary.

100
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:24,729
他们在室内不行礼 Gary
They don't salute indoors, Gary.

101
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,252
早上好 陆战队员们 女士
- Good morning, Marine. - Ma'am.

102
00:04:26,253 --> 00:04:28,198
你在伊拉克服役过?我知道了
You served in Iraq? I see.

103
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:30,399
那么你有到...附近
And were you anywhere near...

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,522
巴格达 安巴尔
Baghdad. - Anbar.

105
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:33,045
...安巴尔? 是的
- ...Anbar? - Yes.

106
00:04:33,046 --> 00:04:34,424
安巴尔 太棒了
Anbar, wonderful.

107
00:04:34,425 --> 00:04:36,114
女士 这个基地驻扎的是陆战二队
Ma'am, this base houses Marine 2.

108
00:04:36,115 --> 00:04:38,782
我知道陆战二队在这里
I understand that Marine 2 is here.

109
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,717
你知道我CD播放器里有《飞行的女武神》吗 (瓦格纳著名进行曲)
And did you know in the CD player I've got Ride of the Valkyries?

110
00:04:41,718 --> 00:04:43,596
《现代启示录》
Apocalypse Now.

111
00:04:43,597 --> 00:04:46,176
是我最喜欢的电影之一 黑暗 但我喜欢
That's one of my favorite films. It's dark, but I like it.

112
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:48,055
陆战队员们喜欢被称作魔犬 魔犬
Marines Like to be called Devil Dogs. - Devil Dogs.

113
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:51,346
你们就是一群魔犬 这就是我听说的
You are a bunch of Devil Dogs, that's what I hear.

114
00:04:51,347 --> 00:04:53,425
我嫁给了一只魔犬 但他不是海军陆战队的
I was married to a Devil Dog, but he wasn't a Marine.

115
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,193
他比魔鬼更黑暗
He was more of a devil.

116
00:04:56,194 --> 00:04:59,006
她真有趣
She's so funny.

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,975
谢谢你对国家的贡献
Thank you for your service.

118
00:05:01,976 --> 00:05:04,844
早上好  陆战队员 他有张漂亮的脸
- Good morning, Marine. - He has a nice face.

119
00:05:04,845 --> 00:05:07,513
你有张漂亮的脸 谢谢 女士
- You have a nice face. - Thank you, ma'am.

120
00:05:07,514 --> 00:05:10,059
你在哪服役来着 陆战队员?
And where did you serve, Marine?

121
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,701
停止开火!停止开火!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

122
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:25,259
这些小型武器的有效射程是25码
These small arms have a max effective range of 25 yards.

123
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,849
小型武器指的是手枪 女士
Small arms means guns, ma'am.

124
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,895
哦 是吗 Gary?不是霸王龙的手? (小短手) 好吧
- Oh, really, Gary? Not T-rex hands? - Okay.

125
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:31,273
部长先生 您要试试么
Mr. Secretary, would you like to try?

126
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:33,553
不 我很好 我开过枪
No, I'm good. I've fired a gun before.

127
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:34,698
好吧
Okay.

128
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:37,411
在盛怒之下 我恐怕得加上 哦 喔哦
- In anger, too, I might add. - Oh, uh-oh.

129
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:39,579
不过你为什么不试试 副总统女士?
But why don't you give it a try, Madam Vice President?

130
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,714
哦 我不
Oh, I don't...

131
00:05:42,715 --> 00:05:46,116
唔 你能给我半秒钟么
Um, can you give me just half a sec?

132
00:05:46,117 --> 00:05:48,196
搞毛啊
What the fuck?

133
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:50,275
可能会回火 不可能会回火
- This could backfire. - It's not gonna backfire.

134
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:52,678
正确的说 手枪是会回火的 那个词就是这么来的
The gun could literally backfire. That's where the phrase comes from.

135
00:05:52,679 --> 00:05:54,558
女士 这也会击败Maddox
Ma'am, this could really chap Maddox's ass, too.

136
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,082
哦 是的 那会 会吗?
Oh, yeah, it would, wouldn't it?

137
00:05:56,083 --> 00:05:58,362
你的牙齿贴片可能会崩的 我真心不希望发生那样的事
You could chip a veneer and I don't really want that to happen.

138
00:05:58,363 --> 00:05:59,940
我不管了 我去了
I don't care. I'm going in.

139
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:01,921
你们知道吗? 拉上保险然后装子弹 怎么样?
You know what? Let's lock and load. What do you say?

140
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:04,859
是吗? 是
Yeah? Yeah.

141
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,108
就是他 西翼Kanye
Here he is, Kanye West Wing.

142
00:06:07,109 --> 00:06:08,890
国会议员Ramsey 对吗?
Congressman Ramsey, right?

143
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:11,607
不 我是Cliff 我是Sue的Sue
No, I'm Cliff. I'm Sue's Sue.

144
00:06:11,608 --> 00:06:14,178
我是那个叫Sue的男孩 什么?
- I'm the boy named Sue. - What?

145
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,816
Cliff 我说不开玩笑 那就不是个玩笑
Cliff, when I said no jokes, that wasn't a joke.

146
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:19,658
Sue Hessler的效率听证会 你得装傻 懂吗
Sue, Hessler's efficiency hearing, you've got to keep it dull, okay?

147
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,696
就给他们说废话
Give 'em a blah job. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

148
00:06:22,697 --> 00:06:24,808
我知道 Jonah 每个人都这么说
I know, Jonah. That's what everyone's been saying.

149
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:28,277
装傻这个行为本身就很傻
Keep it dull, which incidentally, is also dull.

150
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:32,101
首先我想感谢副总统
I'd like to first of all thank the vice president

151
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:34,314
舍弃了行政特权
for waiving executive privilege

152
00:06:34,315 --> 00:06:36,060
为了透明度
in the interest of transparency

153
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,953
并允许Wilson小姐今天出席
and allowing Miss Wilson to join us today on the committee.

154
00:06:39,954 --> 00:06:41,968
你觉得她紧张吗?
Do you think she's nervous?

155
00:06:41,969 --> 00:06:44,122
她为什么要紧张?
Why would she be nervous?

156
00:06:44,123 --> 00:06:45,912
会看这个的除了你就只有
The only people watching this are you

157
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:48,399
医院里那群有闭锁综合征的人了 (无法动弹)
and some guy in the hospital with locked-in syndrome.

158
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,909
如果可以 我想从
If I may, I'd like to begin with percentages

159
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,559
你们办公室划分给国际国内运输
of your office budget dedicated to international

160
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,921
的那部分预算开始 我的脉搏都狂跳了 先生
<i>- and domestic transportation. - My pulse is racing, sir.</i>

161
00:06:56,922 --> 00:06:58,447
给 副总统女士
Here you are, Madam Vice President.

162
00:06:58,448 --> 00:07:00,063
请确保你的手指是直的 并且不在扳机上
Ensure you keep your finger straight and off the trigger.

163
00:07:00,064 --> 00:07:02,545
好 这很有意思 不是吗?
All right. This is fun, isn't it?

164
00:07:02,546 --> 00:07:06,108
如果你不介意我说 女士 那是平民的语气
If you don't mind my saying, ma'am, there speaketh a civilian.

165
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,881
好吧 那是蠢货的语气
All right. There speaketh a pricketh.

166
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:14,204
哦 我勒个大艹
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

167
00:07:14,205 --> 00:07:16,744
Oh!

168
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:19,260
哦 我很抱歉 我无意...
Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't...

169
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:21,211
这些伙计们听过比那更糟糕的 女士
These fellas have heard a lot worse than that, ma'am.

170
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,394
顺说 惊人的射击 真的?
- Tremendous shot, by the way. - Really?

171
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:27,393
哦 那个怎么样?西翼最快的枪
Oh, how about that? Fastest gun in the West Wing.

172
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:30,132
你看到了吗? 是的 女士
<i- >- - Did you see that? How about it? Yes, ma'am.

173
00:07:30,133 --> 00:07:33,270
就像你们知道的 今天我们这有个很特殊的客人
As you know, we have a very special guest here today.

174
00:07:33,271 --> 00:07:36,172
如果之前能讨论你的演讲就好了 女士
It would have been nice to have been consulted about your speech, ma'am.

175
00:07:36,173 --> 00:07:38,574
我可以给你一些建议
I could have given you some advice.

176
00:07:38,575 --> 00:07:40,176
我知道我在做什么 George
I know what I'm doing, George.

177
00:07:40,177 --> 00:07:42,044
对于人质危机
With this hostage situation,

178
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,480
我不认为你有足够的情报(智力)来处理
I don't think you have the intelligence.

179
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:48,818
我当然说的是情报 女士
As in intel, of course, ma'am.

180
00:07:48,819 --> 00:07:50,220
你认真的?
Are you serious?

181
00:07:50,221 --> 00:07:53,023
你现在是在质疑我的资格 George?
Are you actually questioning my qualifications, George?

182
00:07:53,024 --> 00:07:55,726
那只是些有关
There are just some security issues

183
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:58,762
乌兹别克斯坦周围四个国家的安全问题
with the four countries that neighbor Uzbekistan.

184
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,700
是四个还是五个?
Is it four or is it five?

185
00:08:04,503 --> 00:08:07,271
或者六个? 七个?
Or is it six? Or is it seven?

186
00:08:07,272 --> 00:08:09,406
你不知道 对吗?
You don't know, do you?

187
00:08:11,476 --> 00:08:13,377
是五个
It's five.

188
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:17,181
那么首先 请欢迎国防部长George Maddox
So first, please welcome the Secretary of Defense George Maddox.

189
00:08:19,184 --> 00:08:21,085
我完全没有准备那个问题
I pulled that straight out of my ass.

190
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:23,221
你就是为那一刻而生的
You were born for that moment.

191
00:08:23,222 --> 00:08:25,023
我知道 他就是硫磺岛 (硫磺岛战役胜利后美军在该岛折钵山上插入国旗)
I know. He's Iwo Jima.

192
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:27,426
我正在他的头上插旗子
I'm planting a flag right on his head.

193
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:31,063
如果我们可以 现在我打算将
Now I'd like to work on breaking down

194
00:08:31,064 --> 00:08:34,634
副总统公务上的
the vice president's official

195
00:08:34,635 --> 00:08:37,170
以及政治上的职责分类
<i>versus political duties if we can.</i>

196
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:40,206
先生 我被告知我会被问及效率方面的问题
Sir, I was told that I'd be asked questions about efficiency.

197
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:42,609
目前为止你几乎没问过
So far you have barely asked me any.

198
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,645
你的效率听证会可不怎么有效率
Your efficiency hearing isn't very efficient.

199
00:08:45,646 --> 00:08:47,814
你想要问题么?
You want a question? What can you tell me

200
00:08:47,815 --> 00:08:49,949
关于Quantico海军基地的访问你能说些什么?
about this visit to the Marine base at Quantico?

201
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,720
政府让两个不同的车队去同一个地方
The government sending two different motorcades, the defense secretary's

202
00:08:53,721 --> 00:08:56,089
一个是国防部长的 一个是副总统的
and the VP's, to the same location.

203
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:59,325
那看上去一点效率都没有 哦 他妈的狗屎
- That doesn't seem very efficient. - Oh, shit a shark.

204
00:08:59,326 --> 00:09:01,094
这就是为什么我告诉她要装聋作哑
This is why I told her to be dull.

205
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:04,231
你们之前难道没有任何
Do you not have measures in place to prevent

206
00:09:04,232 --> 00:09:06,833
可防止此类浪费政府资源的重复行为吗
this kind of wasteful duplication of government resources?

207
00:09:06,834 --> 00:09:10,304
先生 我们有一套我认为很...
Sir, we have a system that I believe to be...

208
00:09:10,305 --> 00:09:12,172
坚定的系统
robust.

209
00:09:12,173 --> 00:09:15,009
坚定? 坚定
Robust? - Robust.

210
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,344
你不觉得那是
<i>And you don't think it's a sign</i>

211
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:18,913
你们办公室管理松散的信号?
that your office is poorly managed?

212
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:23,384
我们的管理团队是...坚定的
Our management team is... robust.

213
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:25,853
好吧 她现在听起来就像精神有问题
Okay, now she just sounds mentally ill.

214
00:09:25,854 --> 00:09:27,989
你就没有你该去的地方?
Don't you have somewhere you're supposed to be?

215
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,491
我正远程工作
I'm working remotely.

216
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:32,361
我猜你有一份每日一词的日历
I'm guessing you have one of those word a day calendars.

217
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,763
我知道今天的词是什么
And I know what the word for today is.

218
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:36,465
坚定
It's robust.

219
00:09:36,466 --> 00:09:38,833
你要不要再给我个定义?
<i>Would you like to give me a definition as well?</i>

220
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:42,770
好吧 我想您认为您有幽默感 Hessler先生
Well, I'm guessing that you think you have a sense of humor, Mr. Hessler.

221
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:46,207
但您错了 就像您对日历的事情也弄错了一样
Which you are wrong about, as you are about the calendar.

222
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:49,510
你错误的地方就是我关于坚定的定义
That is my definition of robust.

223
00:09:49,511 --> 00:09:52,479
我的演讲词写得太有冲击力了 这些当兵的肯定都被震了
My speech is a face-melter. These buzz cuts are gonna flip.

224
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,015
那不是你写的演讲词 上面布满了我的指印
It's not your speech. My fingerprints are all over that sucker.

225
00:09:55,016 --> 00:09:57,451
那些指印都很黏糊 而且都在后面 Mike
They're sticky and they're on the back, Mike.

226
00:09:57,452 --> 00:10:00,587
是时候祭出坚定大词镇住全场了
It's time to robust a nut all over this place.

227
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:02,322
哦 狗屎 我们不能 什么?
- Oh, shit. We can't. - What?

228
00:10:02,323 --> 00:10:05,392
Sue 她在听证会上刚用了三次坚定
Sue, she just used robust three times at the hearing.

229
00:10:05,393 --> 00:10:06,994
不 她没有 是 他妈...
- No, she didn't. - Yeah. What the...?

230
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,896
Selina现在不能用那个 我们需要另一个词
Selina can't use that now. We need another word.

231
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:10,331
一个坚定的同义词
Just a synonym for robust.

232
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:12,400
给我什么 给我个词 随便什么词!
Give me something. Give me a word. Any word!

233
00:10:12,401 --> 00:10:13,033
激进的
Aggressive.

234
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,559
不 那太激进了 我们不想说那个
No, that's too aggressive. We don't want to say that.

235
00:10:14,594 --> 00:10:17,005
好吧 坚决的 果断的
- Okay, resolute. - Determined.

236
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:19,407
那和坚决的是一个意思 那用我的
- That's the exact same thing as resolute. - Then we'll use mine.

237
00:10:19,408 --> 00:10:21,644
爆炸性的 强有力的 无惧的 我只是在随口说而已
Explosive. Punchy. Fearless. I'm just saying words.

238
00:10:21,645 --> 00:10:23,746
强烈的 用强烈的 强烈? 强烈 知道了
- Strong. Go with strong. - Strong? Strong, got it.

239
00:10:23,747 --> 00:10:25,815
Gary 我需要那份演讲 我要副总统的耳朵(附过来)
Gary, I need the speech. I need the vice president's ear.

240
00:10:25,816 --> 00:10:27,317
去找你自己的耳朵吧 梵高
Get your own ear, van Gogh.

241
00:10:27,318 --> 00:10:28,652
退后
Back off.

谢谢
Thank you.

243
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,791
谢谢 搞什么鬼?
<i>- Thank you. - What the hell?</i>

244
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:35,693
早上好 陆战队员们
Good morning, Marines!

245
00:10:36,661 --> 00:10:39,096
- Oorah. - Oorah!

246
00:10:39,097 --> 00:10:41,965
哦 天哪

为这个伟大国家效力的人都知道
this great nation know this,

那些向我们的自由发起挑战的人
<i>that those who challenge our freedoms</i>

00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:55,346
必将得到一个坚定的回答
can expect a robust response.

251
00:10:55,347 --> 00:10:58,615
R弹就此投下了 我以为我们不用坚定这个词了
- There goes the R-bomb. - I thought we weren't doing robust.

252
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,283
我以为我们还在深思熟虑中
I thought we were still on considered.

253
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:03,820
我们有这个世界上最好的军队
We have the best military in the world.

254

而且我们无所畏惧
And we are not afraid.

正在掰臀瓣呢
Parting the cheeks.

259
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,707
你知道坚定是我的词 她偷了我的词
You know robust is my word. She stole my word.

260
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,375
她本该装傻的 Mike
She was supposed to be dull, Mike.

261

你在《政客》上有看到我的那张照片了吗?
<i>And did you see that photo of me in Politico?</i>

262

你看起来不像便秘 而是相反的那种状况
<i>You don't look constipated. You look the opposite of it.</i>

265
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,620
便秘的反面是什么 Mike
What's the opposite of constipated, Mike?

266
00:11:35,621 --> 00:11:37,188
放松的 不
Relieved. - No.

267
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:40,090
放松可不是便秘的反面 Mike
Relieved is not the opposite of constipated, Mike.

268
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:42,193
挂上电话 笨蛋
Hang up the phone, dummy.

269

今早《特区报纸》出的词汇云
It's a word cloud from this morning's DC Press.

275
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,578
每个词的大小都和它们被使用的总次数挂钩
The size of each word corresponds to its total number of uses.

276
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:03,547
人们难道不再使用句子了吗
Do people not use sentences anymore?

00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:16,859
它 呃...
It's, uh...

284
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,528
我刚刚看到了
I just saw it.

285

哈! 那里 就在那
Ha! There. There it is.

286
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:22,964
看它有多微小
Look how teeny tiny that is.

287
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:24,867
它比崩溃大
It's bigger than collapse.

288
00:12:24,868 --> 00:12:27,436
它那么微小是因为技术上你有四个名字
It's teeny tiny because technically you have four names.

289
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:29,004
副 总统 Selina Meyer
Vice President Selina Meyer.

00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:31,773
哦 还有那些...我们不会谈论的昵称
Yeah, plus all the nicknames that we don't talk about.

291
00:12:31,774 --> 00:12:35,010
我是说 而Sue只有一个名字 就像波卡洪塔斯(印第安公主)或者希特勒一样
I mean, Sue only has one name like Pocahontas or Hitler.

292
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:37,279
或者莫比(《白鲸记》)和大脚怪什么的 嘿 Sue
- Or Moby or Bigfoot. - Hey, Sue!

293
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,681
Sue! 是的 女士?
- Sue! - Yes, ma'am?

294
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:42,284
什么? 你他妈的不是Sue
What? You're not fucking Sue.

295
00:12:42,285 --> 00:12:44,653
我是Cliff 我正在顶Sue的班
I'm Cliff. I'm filling in for Sue

296
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:46,721
她正为6号的二次听证做准备
while she preps for her return appearance on the sixth.

297
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:48,357
她要二次听证?
She has a return appearance?

298
00:12:48,358 --> 00:12:49,691
她返场要做什么?
What does she need an encore for?

299
00:12:49,692 --> 00:12:51,660
啊 那就是个返场表演 开始准备你的爆米花吧
Yeah, it's an encore. Start popping your popcorn.

300
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:53,195
好吧 非常感谢 非Sue不可电视台
- Okay, thank you very much. - Must Sue TV.

301
00:12:53,196 --> 00:12:54,696
我说够了 谢谢
I said that's enough. Thank you.

302
00:12:54,697 --> 00:12:56,198
Gary 我们需要开始准备
Gary, we need to start prepping

303
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,867
所有参议员的就职仪式了
for the whole senator swearing-in thing.

304
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,936
哦 是的 到了Gary-OK时间了 是的
- Oh, yeah. It's Gary-oke time. - Yes, it is.

305

好吧 我会为每个参议员准备一张卡片
All right, I put together one card for each senator.

306
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,807
事实上 女士 我对这儿的机会有些想法
Actually, ma'am, I had some ideas about some opportunities here.

307
00:13:05,808 --> 00:13:08,443
我觉得如果我们能
I think it'd be a good idea if we focus more

308
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:11,846
更多的专注每个参议员各自的政策 而不是闲话家常的话会很好
on each senator's particular policy interests rather than small talk.

309
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:14,448
哦 我不认为那是个坏主意 什么?
- Yeah, I don't think that's a bad idea. - What?

310
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:16,550
是的 拿着外套 我觉得可行
Yeah, take the coat. That makes sense to me.

311
00:13:16,551 --> 00:13:17,751
我想...哦 Sue在那
I think that... oh, there's Sue.

312
00:13:17,752 --> 00:13:19,854
好的 离我远点 Sue!
Okay, get away from me. Sue!

313
00:13:19,855 --> 00:13:22,923
Sue! 不 真的Sue
Sue! No, the real Sue.

314
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:25,226
离她的耳朵远点 听到了吗
You stay away from her ear. Do you hear me?

315
00:13:25,227 --> 00:13:27,695
Gary-OK已经完了 我的朋友 现在是Danny-OK的时代了
Gary-oke is done, my friend. It's time for Danny-oke now.

316
00:13:27,696 --> 00:13:31,132
Danny-OK? 一个时代的结束 哥们 一个时代的结束
- Danny-oke? - End of an era, buddy. End of an era.

317
00:13:31,133 --> 00:13:33,501
别犯蠢了 我不出名
Don't be ridiculous. I'm not famous.

318
00:13:33,502 --> 00:13:35,403
也许只在特区
Maybe only in DC.

319

哦 是的 我和Kim Kardashian (卡戴珊家族的风头人物)
Oh, yeah, me and Kim Kardashian.

320
00:13:37,706 --> 00:13:39,874
哦 我得走了 再见 再见 再见 女士?
Oh, I've got to go. Bye, bye, bye. Ma'am?

321
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:42,644
你为什么不坐下来 Sue? 哦 抱歉 女士
- Why don't you take a seat, Sue? - Oh, sorry, ma'am.

322
00:13:42,645 --> 00:13:44,313
坐下 Sue
Sit down, Sue.

323
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:46,282
好吧 我得跟你说说理...
All right, I've got a bone to pick...

324
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,284
女士 我知道你很喜欢我 但现在你会要恨我
Ma'am, I know you really love me, but now you're gonna hate me.

325
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,025
什么?
What?

326
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:51,345
国防部长Maddox刚和彭博通讯社做了访谈
Sec Def Maddox just did an interview with Bloomberg.

327
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,214
啊?
Yeah?

328
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:54,409
他现在的措辞是激进的回应
He's now calling for an aggressive response.

329
00:13:54,444 --> 00:13:57,395
激进的? 是的 我也刚收到了
<i- >- - Aggressive? Yeah, I just got that, too.

330
00:13:57,396 --> 00:13:59,463
激进把坚定给灭了?
Does aggressive trump robust?

331
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,198
这词更坚定
Well, it's robustier.

332
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,734
不 坚定就像石头 而激进像是布
No, robust is like a rock and aggressive is like paper.

333
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:05,870
糟了 布包石头啊 我忘了
Oh, shoot, paper covers rock. I forget about that.

334
00:14:05,871 --> 00:14:08,539
刚收到Ben的短信 然后呢 他说什么
- We just got a text from Ben. - And? What's his word?

335
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:11,842
原话是:把-副-总-统-弄-这-儿-来 我-们-要-他-妈-开-会
His word is get-the-vice-president-over-here right-now-we're-having-a-fucking-meeting.

336
00:14:11,843 --> 00:14:14,311
全用连字符连成了一个词
It's all one word hyphenated.

337
00:14:15,713 --> 00:14:17,414
提醒我一下 你演讲怎么说的?
Remind me, you said what?

338
00:14:17,415 --> 00:14:19,282
你的回应应该怎样? 坚定
your response needs to be What? - Robust.

339
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:21,418
坚定 然后你说? 激进
Robust. And you said? - Aggressive.

340
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:23,753
看到问题了吗 没有
- You see the problem? - No, I don't.

341
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:25,021
这俩是不同的词
They're different words.

342
00:14:25,022 --> 00:14:27,290
不同的词意味着什么?
And saying different words means what?

343
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:30,360
意味着我们的...
It means we're not on the same...

344
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:31,695
减肥菜单不同? 意见不同
Diet? - Page.

345
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,696
我以为你要说减肥菜单呢 Ben
Oh, I thought you were gonna say diet, Ben.

346
00:14:33,697 --> 00:14:37,101
我不喜欢你的腔调 而且这件事我也不用向你
- I don't like your tone. - And I don't have to answer to you, Ben.

347
00:14:37,102 --> 00:14:39,336
或者是Lara Croft 汇报 Ben
Or to Lara Croft here for that matter.

348
00:14:39,337 --> 00:14:42,272
也许不是 但我们都为总统工作
Yeah, perhaps not, but we all work for the president.

349
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:45,209
顺便问一下 伟大法力强大的Oz国巫师在哪儿啊
Oh, where is the great and powerful Oz, by the way?

350
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,178
听着 我们都知道如果白宫没有总统
Listen, we all know the White House would work so much better

351
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:50,347
会运转得更好 但是确实有
if there wasn't a president, but there is.

352
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,982
所以我们只能接受
So we work around that.

353
00:14:51,983 --> 00:14:53,383
具体表现就是
<i>And we do that by sticking</i>

354
00:14:53,384 --> 00:14:55,852
得使用同一个操蛋的词
to the same fucking words.

355
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,488
而你的工作就是协调此事 大师
And it's your job to coordinate that, maestro.

356
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:02,660
没错 所以从现在开始 那个词是有计划的回应
That's right. So from now on, the words are calculated response.

357
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:05,896
有计划 这个听起来很...
Calculated? That sounds so...

358
00:15:05,897 --> 00:15:08,299
有计划 很娘 我打算这么说
- Calculated? - Pussy-ass, that's what I was gonna say.

359
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,935
你得在总统屁股底下点把火
<i>You've got to light a fire under the president's butt.</i>

360
00:15:10,936 --> 00:15:12,970
赶紧来点实际行动吧
Let's get some action here.

361
00:15:12,971 --> 00:15:15,773
她开了一次枪就以为自己是沙漠里的隆美尔元帅 (二战德军著名将领 绰号沙漠之狐)
She fires a gun one time and she thinks she's Rommel in the desert.

362
00:15:15,774 --> 00:15:17,708
告诉你 我是个好枪手
Yeah, let me tell you something. I'm a good shot.

363
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,810
知道吗 我可能要开始 知道吗
You know what? I may even start... you know,

364
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:22,279
不管怎么说吧  携枪 这个如何
whatever it's called... packing heat. How about that?

365
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,682
你这么做的时候 就是我支持枪支管制的时候
When you do that, I'm gonna start supporting gun control.

366
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,484
我有面条的消息了 他在说什么
- I have news on the noodles. - What's he talking about?

367
00:15:27,485 --> 00:15:30,154
人质的事我们可以行动了 面条好新闻啊
We Can move on The hostages. - Cock-a-noodle-doo.

368
00:15:30,155 --> 00:15:32,857
天啊 我现在都想亲你了 但我永远不会这么做
Oh, my God. I'd kiss you right now, but I'm never gonna do that.

369
00:15:32,858 --> 00:15:36,027
我们最快可以6号或者9号行动
Earliest we could go in would be the sixth or the ninth.

370

我们得早点 你知道总统大人的啦
We got to go early. You know POTUS.

371
00:15:38,363 --> 00:15:40,364
如果我们给他充足的时间 他会改变主意的
If we give him enough time, he's gonna change his mind.

372
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:42,500
他会永远拖下去的
He's gonna procrasterbate forever.

373
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:44,635
副总统女士 哈? 在
Madam Vice President? - Huh? Yeah.

00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,073
一秒钟
One second.

376
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:54,379
Amy 给办公室打电话
Amy, call the office.

377
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:56,848
副总统办公室 是副总统
Office of The Vice President. - this is The Vice President.

378
00:15:56,849 --> 00:15:59,418
是的 不 不 我是副总统
- Yes, it is. - No, no, this is the vice president.

379
00:15:59,419 --> 00:16:01,920

<i>- Oh, okay. I'm sorry, ma'am. - It's fine.</i>

看看我的行事历 看看6号那天
Look into my calendar and tell me if there is anything

381
00:16:04,223 --> 00:16:06,725
有没有不能推的事
on the sixth that is immovable.

382
00:16:06,726 --> 00:16:08,627
没有 女士 看起来都可以推掉
Uh, no, ma'am, it all looks moveable.

383
00:16:08,628 --> 00:16:11,797
唯一不能推的就是Sue在6号的二次听证会
The only thing that can't move is Sue's second hearing appearance on the sixth.

384
00:16:11,798 --> 00:16:14,400
噢 那是6号? 是的 女士
<i>- Oh, that's on the sixth? - Yes, ma'am.</i>

咱们尽快把这些孩子送回家吧
Let's bring these kids home as soon as possible.

388
00:16:23,944 --> 00:16:24,901
那就这么定了?
So we're all agreed?

389
00:16:24,934 --> 00:16:27,228
6号对坏人来说将是糟糕的一天
The sixth, it's gonna be a bad day for the bad guys.

390
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:29,182
咱们去找总统大人吧
Let's go find POTUS.

391
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:39,091
你选6号是因为比9号早?
Now you went with the sixth because it's before the ninth?

392
00:16:39,092 --> 00:16:41,194
当然 跟Sue回委员会听证这事没关系?
- Yeah, of course. - And Sue's return to the committee

393
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:43,562
你知道我对什么感兴趣吗
- has nothing to do with it? - You know what I'm interested in?

394
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:47,133
把无辜的美国人安全送回家
Getting innocent Americans home safe and sound, right?

395
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:52,372
把6号所有的事都给我推了
Move everything off of the sixth for me.

396
00:16:52,373 --> 00:16:54,173
你可以把那天的日程清空了 好的 女士
- You can clear that. - Absolutely, ma'am.

397
00:16:54,174 --> 00:16:56,542
唯一我需要推的就是参议员宣誓就职典礼
The only thing I need to move is the senator swearing-in ceremony,

398
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,311
所以没问题

399
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,250
什么
What?

参议员宣誓就职典礼
The senator swearing-in ceremony.

401
00:17:07,621 --> 00:17:09,756
你说一切都可以推
You said that everything was moveable.

402
00:17:09,757 --> 00:17:11,625
这不能推啊
And that's not moveable.

403
00:17:11,626 --> 00:17:14,628
这不能推
That's immoveable.

404
00:17:14,629 --> 00:17:16,464
当然没什么不能推的
Surely nothing is immoveable.

405
00:17:16,465 --> 00:17:19,868
Amy 这就像对牛弹琴
Amy, this is like explaining gravity to a chicken.

406
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:22,736
参议员宣誓典礼是板上钉钉的事了
The senator swearing-in ceremony is set in stone.

407
00:17:22,737 --> 00:17:24,138
她是参议院主席
She's the president of the Senate.

408
00:17:24,139 --> 00:17:26,006
所有新当选的参议员宣誓就职都得她主持
She swears in all newly elected senators.

409
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,208
对吧 懂吗 明白吗
Right? You get that? You understand it?

410
00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:30,377
你需要Google一下吗 不 女士 我懂
- Do you need to Google it? - No, ma'am, I understand.

411
00:17:30,378 --> 00:17:32,246
我觉得你不懂
I don't think you do understand.

412
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:33,580
因为你在笑 你为什么笑
Because you are grinning. Why are you grinning?

413
00:17:33,581 --> 00:17:35,148
我没笑 你在笑
- I'm not grinning. - You are grinning.

414
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:38,985
你惹了法国那么大的麻烦
You have made a fuckup the size of France

415
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:41,788
还有脸笑?
and you are fucking grinning about it.

416
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:43,856
我尽量不笑 我不知道我的脸为什么这种形状
I'm trying not to. I'm not sure why my face is doing this.

417
00:17:43,857 --> 00:17:46,192
靠 好吧
- Oh, damn it. - Okay.

418
00:17:48,328 --> 00:17:49,829
我不知道怎么回事
I don't know what's going on,

419
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,999
但她不是刚才那个意思
but she didn't mean what she just said, okay?

420
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,568
好吧 女士 还有什么事

一个海军陆战队员 第二侦察营

不 我认为他...
No, I believe he lost from above...

580
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,042
从膝盖之上往下基本没有腿了
he basically doesn't have a leg from above the knee down.

581
00:24:41,212 --> 00:24:43,179
他是行动中的一员吗

582
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,349
是的 他本来应该8号轮岗的
Yes. He was actually due to be rotated out on the eighth.

不 他现在在医学昏迷中
No, he's in an induced coma.

589
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,295

But I suppose when he wakes up...

590
00:25:03,934 --> 00:25:05,768
我需要点新鲜空气 抱歉

不止拯救了人质
Not only did you rescue the hostages,

599
00:25:32,931 --> 00:25:35,165
而且全歼了Sue
but you annihilated Sue.

600
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:38,235
你选了她听证那天来行动
You picked the operation date to blow her appearance off the map.

601
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:40,504
我是说 天才啊 女士 天才啊
I mean, genius play, ma'am. Genius.

602

我称之为暗中出击
I call that overshadowboxing.

603
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,641
知道吗 Dan
You know what, Dan?

604
00:25:44,642 --> 00:25:47,945
你一直离一个人耳边这么近的叨叨
The problem with being so close to somebody's ear all the time

605
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:51,215
你会开始觉得你能读懂他们的心思
is that you begin to think that you can see inside their head,

606
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,818
但你不能 Dan 你不能
but you can't, Dan. You can't.

607
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:57,423
明白吗 明白 女士
- Do you understand that? - Understood, ma'am.

608

一个时代结束了
End of an era.

613

我害一个人失去了一条腿
I lost a man his leg.

614
00:26:15,309 --> 00:26:17,110
不要再说了 女士
Please stop saying that, ma'am.

615
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,945
他会重新站起来的 我有感觉
He'll bounce back. I got a feeling.

616
00:26:18,946 --> 00:26:21,014
女士 副总统有时得
Ma'am, the vice president sometimes has to do

617
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,916
做坏事才能得来好结果
bad things to make good things happen.

618
00:26:22,917 --> 00:26:25,318
这条腿只是你所付出的代价
The leg is just the price of admission

619
00:26:25,319 --> 00:26:27,053
为了达到现在这个位置
to the place you wanted to be.

620
00:26:27,054 --> 00:26:29,523
也许我们可以邀请他去白宫
Well, maybe we could invite him to the White House.

621
00:26:29,524 --> 00:26:32,393
知道吗 一旦他重新站...
You know, once he's back up on his...

622
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:35,763
当然 我们会把他推上坡道的
Sure, we'll roll out the ramps.

623
00:26:38,567 --> 00:26:41,802
女士 这年头他们用的义肢
Ma'am, some of the prosthetic legs they have these days

624
00:26:41,803 --> 00:26:43,304
有的和真腿一样好
are as good as real legs.

625
00:26:43,305 --> 00:26:45,606
我向你保证他们比我的烂腿好
I guarantee you they're better than my shitty legs.

626
00:26:45,607 --> 00:26:49,377
我讨厌我的腿 事实上 如果我有选择
I hate my legs. In fact, if I had the choice...

627
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:53,314
Huh?

628
00:26:53,315 --> 00:26:56,116
无所谓 我要走了
Never mind. I'm gonna go.

629
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:59,686
嘿 女士 想来点
Hey, ma'am. How would you like

630
00:26:59,687 --> 00:27:02,989
杏仁小面包吗
a nice little almond croissant?

631
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,558
当然 太好了
Oh, yeah. I would love that.

632
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,293
好的 好的
Okay. Okay.

633
00:27:06,294 --> 00:27:08,228
能弄大点吗
Can you make it a big one

634
00:27:08,229 --> 00:27:10,864
所以你可以把我塞面包里
so you can stuff me inside of it

635
00:27:10,865 --> 00:27:12,065
然后把我偷运出去吗
and smuggle me out of here?

636
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,034
当然
Of course I can.

637
00:27:14,035 --> 00:27:17,103
里面可能还会有覆盆子惊喜噢
And there might be a little raspberry surprise in them.

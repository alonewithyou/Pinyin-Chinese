上帝呀 包包 你总是想着包包

在抢风调向时倾斜身体 你的大蛋蛋就会浸到海水中
Leaning out in the tack, your big man balls dipping in the salty sea.

60
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:45,435

别对我们这群玩帆船的说动力船 Dan
You don't talk powerboating to us sailors, Dan.

67
00:03:03,687 --> 00:03:05,288
有他妈什么不同啊!
What's the fucking difference?

68
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,026

你已经将大楼里所有人的秘密都打听清楚了?
You've already bugged the shit out of everyone else in the building?

71

不 我只是在猜薪水的差别
No, I'm guessing that's the difference in salary

77
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,253
这个工作和你刚面试过的那个工作的薪水

78
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:37,788
你觉得我去面试了?
You think I had a job interview?

怎么知道的 大侦探? 简单的妆容 高高的领口
- How, Sherlock? - Simple makeup, higher neckline.

81
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:44,695
平底鞋和那条裙子不搭 说明你包里大概会有双高跟鞋
Flats don't go with that dress, which means you probably have heels in your bag.

82
00:03:44,696 --> 00:03:46,631
本地面包店的咖啡表明你去过

83

Really? What's he gonna be doing?

89
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:01,613
我想他会把bon Jovi从燃烧的坦克里拖出来 (摇滚巨星)
I think he'll be pulling Bon Jovi out of a burning tank

90
00:04:01,614 --> 00:04:03,582

A meme, an Internet phenomenon.

140
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:11,777
好吧 是的 这张照片被处理过的版本
Okay, yes. There are Photoshopped versions of this

141
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:13,579
在推特上到处转发
springing up all over Twitter.

142
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,547
您在《独立宣言》的发表日... 哦 天哪
- You at the Declaration of Independence... - Oh, my God.

143
00:06:15,548 --> 00:06:18,050
和抹大拉的马利亚在耶稣罹难日（圣经故事）
With Mary Magdalene at the crucifixion,

144
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:20,186
还有04年的海啸
the 2004 tsunami.

145
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,422
如果有海啸 你本来就会看手机 因为你要查天气预报
If there was a tsunami, you'd be genuinely looking at your phone

146
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,656
你知道吗 我不需要你说话
'cause you'd be checking the weather.

147
00:06:23,657 --> 00:06:26,125
我们怎样才能停止这狗屎的模因女士?
You know what? I don't need you to talk.

148
00:06:26,126 --> 00:06:27,994
不 只有模因 女士 不是模因女士
How do we stop this meme ma'am shit?

149
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:30,296
通常48小时后它们就销声匿迹了
No, it's just a meme, ma'am. Not a meme ma'am.

150
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:32,932
但有时它们会爆发然后变成超级模因
And usually they flame out after about 48 hours,

151
00:06:32,933 --> 00:06:34,734
就像Downfall (二战影片 其希特勒片段被广为恶搞)
but sometimes they blow up and become a super meme

152
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,702
或者江南Style
like Downfall or Gangnam.

153
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:38,270
我喜欢江南 我刚说了什么?
<i>- I love Gangnam. - What did I just say?</i>

154
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:40,639
如果把它放到Reddit或者Tumblr就有可能会 (前者为社交新闻网 后者为最大轻博客网站)
If it gets on Reddit or Tumblr, that can happen.

155
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,208
是的 好吧 你得从这里出去 可以吗?
Yeah, okay. You've got to get out of here, okay?

156
00:06:43,209 --> 00:06:45,711
带走所有的这些无意义的音节 出去
Take all these meaningless syllables with you and just get out.

157
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:49,515
是的 一点没错 女士 哦 今晚的晚宴见
Yes, absolutely, ma'am. Oh, and I will see you at the dinner tonight.

158
00:06:49,516 --> 00:06:51,217
哦 天哪 啊
Oh, my God, yeah.

159
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:54,420
好吧 嗯 这是一堆破烂里面唯一的好事了
Okay, yeah, that's a cherry on top of this whole turd cake.

160
00:06:54,421 --> 00:06:56,089
噢 你的腿 你能放...?
Ooh, your leg. Could you put...?

161
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,791
把你的腿摆好让我看到它的全貌
Fix your leg so I can see your whole leg.

162
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,160
放好 哦 好吧
Fix it. Yeah. Okay.

163
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:03,064
总统说我们不能在Vic Allen晚宴上
POTUS said that we can't do the song about the Speaker

164
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:04,666
唱那首关于议长的歌 我们不能唱
at the Vic Allen dinner. We can't do it.

165
00:07:04,667 --> 00:07:06,033
议长之歌被砍掉了? 没错
the Speaker song is cut? - Yeah.

166
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,402
那很好笑的 没那么好笑
it was hilarious. - it was not that hilarious.

167
00:07:08,403 --> 00:07:11,639
你疯了吧 哥们 那会让人们尿裤子的
You're out of your head, dude. That would have made people piss in their pants.

168
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,008
Hey, hey, hey!

169
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,076
让我们作首关于Kent的歌吧
Let's do a new song about Kent.

170
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,479
Kent? 嗯
<i>- Kent? - Mm-hmm.</i>

171
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,516
你觉得? 拿我们自己开玩笑 这是他说的
- You think? - Make fun of ourselves, that's what he said.

172
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:23,584
我喜欢这个主意
I kind of like that.

173
00:07:23,585 --> 00:07:25,487
的确 我挺喜欢这个
I do, I kind of like that.

174
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,622
好吧 我们写吧 我没有问题 就这么干吧
All right, we'll do it. I have no problem with that. Let's go.

175
00:07:27,623 --> 00:07:29,858
那就是我们要做的 干吧
That's what we're gonna do. Let's go.

176
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,262
停止这种扰乱议事的行为 捣蛋的家伙
Just stop the filibuster, buster.

177
00:07:33,263 --> 00:07:35,632
不错  但不押韵
<i>- That's good. - That's not a rhyme.</i>

178
00:07:35,633 --> 00:07:38,535
你只是用了同样的词来造词而已
You're just matching a word with the same word.

179
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,537
写下来 Dan 我正在状态中
Just write it down, Dan. I'm in a zone.

180
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:43,540
搞笑歌曲是人渣的标志
Comedy songs are the mark of a douchebag.

181
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,508
你错了 你知道为什么吗?
You're wrong. You know why?

182
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,111
三个词...搞怪 Al Yankovic (美国歌曲恶搞专家)
Three words... Weird Al Yankovic.

183
00:07:48,112 --> 00:07:50,346
狗屎的Al Yankovic
Shit Al Yankoshit.

184
00:07:50,347 --> 00:07:51,981
闭上你的嘴 成吗?
You shut your mouth, okay?

185
00:07:51,982 --> 00:07:55,552
请...保护那些濒危的鹅 Bruce
Just... protect the endangered goose, Bruce.

186
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:58,421
这很棒 模仿《离开爱人的五十种方法》的恶搞之作 (副歌部分有很多以姓名和行为押韵的歌词)
These are all great. A parody song of 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.

187
00:07:58,422 --> 00:07:59,656
好主意 真的?
Great idea. - Really?

188
00:07:59,657 --> 00:08:01,123
没错 如果第一个就失败
- Yeah. - If the first one bombs,

189
00:08:01,124 --> 00:08:02,725
人们就会坐在那想去他妈的
people are gonna be sitting out there thinking,

190
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,960
还有49个这样的玩意
Shit the bed, we got 49 more of these to go.

191
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:07,663
帮帮石油厅吧 Bobby   这个不错
<i>Help the oil lobby, Bobby. That's a good one.</i>

192
00:08:07,664 --> 00:08:09,698
咱们跟踪Jonah吧
Let's follow Jonah.

193
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:12,234
这太幼稚了
That is so childish.

194
00:08:13,302 --> 00:08:15,236
我们为什么做这个?
Why are we doing this?

195
00:08:15,237 --> 00:08:18,239
因为它毫无意义 就像我们做的其他事一样
Because it's pointless, like everything else that we do.

196
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,775
你仍然恼怒着 因为你没法巴结上Kent?
You still pissed you can't get in with Kent?

197
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,977
没人可以 他一半是机器人 一半是机器人
Nobody can. He's half robot, half robot.

198
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:25,345
他是机器人 是的 那就是挑战 Mike
- He's a robot. - Yeah, that's the challenge, Mike.

199
00:08:25,346 --> 00:08:27,214
瞧 大学里所有的女孩都喜欢我
See, in college all the girls liked me.

200
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:30,183
唯一一个女孩 聪明 对我没兴趣
There was this one girl, smart, who had no interest in me.

201
00:08:32,153 --> 00:08:33,987
她也不是同性恋 我确认过了
She wasn't gay either. I checked.

202
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:35,989
所以搞上她就成为了我的使命
So it became my mission to sleep with her.

203
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,691
那么你得手了?
And did you?

204
00:08:39,193 --> 00:08:40,927
没有
No.

205
00:08:40,928 --> 00:08:43,997
那个失败的阴影一直缠住我直到今天
And that failure has haunted me to this very day.

206
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,633
我有个类似的故事 不过恰好相反
I have a similar story, but the other way around.

207
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:50,771
大学里只有一个女孩对我感兴趣
In college there was only one girl that was interested in me.

208
00:08:50,772 --> 00:08:54,107
结果她是个女同性恋
And it turns out she was actually a lesbian.

209
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:00,879
每个人都有些不在状态
<i>Everyone is a little off.</i>

210
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,615
Dan很郁闷 Sue正在找另一份工作
Dan is bored. Sue is looking for another job.

211
00:09:03,616 --> 00:09:04,916
什么?真的?
What? Really?

212
00:09:04,917 --> 00:09:08,353
唔 然后你对Gary说的话...
Mmm, and the stuff you're saying to Gary...

213
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:11,290
什么? Gary对我生气了?
What? Gary's not happy with me?

214
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,258
什么?
What?

215
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,961
因为就算我对他的脸开一枪他都会很高兴
Because he'd be happy if I shot him in the face.

216
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:18,530
他会的 我真的想过这事
He would be. I've actually thought about it.

217
00:09:18,531 --> 00:09:21,233
他觉得自从他有了那个女朋友Dana
He feels since he got that girlfriend Dana,

218
00:09:21,234 --> 00:09:22,567
你对他就很奇怪
<i>you've been weird with him.</i>

219
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:24,570
好吧 可以麻烦你...你能不能不...
Okay, can you please... can you please not...

220
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,772
看吧 这个就是另外一点 腿的事
See? That is another thing. The leg.

221
00:09:26,773 --> 00:09:29,208
好吧 他的确失去了一整条腿
Well, he did lose a whole leg.

222
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:32,144
那就像他该有的一半 对吗?
That's like half of what he should have, right?

223
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:35,614
我很好 瞧 我能搞定这个事
I'm fine. Look, I can handle this whole thing.

224
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:37,716
我能 Sue
I can. Sue.

225
00:09:37,717 --> 00:09:40,152
你对这里极其重要
You are incredibly valued here and I was wondering

226
00:09:40,153 --> 00:09:42,720
我在想我们能做什么事来留住你
if there's anything we could do to make you want to stay with us.

227
00:09:42,721 --> 00:09:44,789

Gary 我会和他聊聊
- Gary. - I'll talk to Gary.

231
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:54,033
在办公室外谈怎么样?
How about doing that outside of the office?

232
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:55,636
邀请他一起晚餐 或许
Invite him to dinner maybe.

233
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:59,640
喔 我从未和Gary一起吃过饭
Wow. I've never eaten with Gary before.

234

Yeah, come at me when you guys get an office, huh?

239
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,057
每个人都讨厌他 没错 但我们是最先讨厌他的
- Everyone hates him. - Yeah, but we hated him first.

240
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:18,360
哦 没错 在讨厌他变成流行之前很久我们就讨厌他了
Oh, yeah, we hated him long before it was even fashionable to hate him.

241
00:10:20,797 --> 00:10:22,665
这就像野生动物纪录片
This is like a wildlife documentary.

242
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:25,868
Jonah在他的自然栖息地 他可能在树丛后拉屎

哦 你可能认为会有一个
Yeah, you'd think there would be.

好吧 我也许很闲 先生们
Well, I might have nothing to do, gentlemen,

273

00:18:56,884 --> 00:18:58,585
我得向Kent假装我不喜欢
I had to pretend not to like it to Kent

428
00:18:58,586 --> 00:19:00,787
而且在他假装喜欢的时候假装喜欢
while pretending to like it like he was pretending to like it,

429
00:19:00,788 --> 00:19:04,391
但实际上他不喜欢而我非常喜欢
but he didn't actually like it and I actually really liked it.

430
00:19:04,392 --> 00:19:06,393
哦 你好 先生
Oh, hello, sir.

431
00:19:06,394 --> 00:19:09,595
女士 你昨晚的歌让我的嘴唇弯曲
Ma'am, your song last night made my lips curl.

432
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:11,197
唔...朝上弯的
Uh... - Upwards.

433
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:13,432
能帮我个小忙么?
I have a small favor to ask.

434
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:15,434
好的 当然 我能为你做什么
Okay, sure. What can I do you for?

435
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:18,437
哦 我的统计梦人口调查项目已经差不多可以开始了
Well, my Dream Metric demographic program is about to launch

436
00:19:18,438 --> 00:19:21,706
我想从你组里借一个人 两周

437
00:19:21,707 --> 00:19:23,441
哦 你想要Dan?

438
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:24,909

439
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:27,912
唔 不 你不想要我 先生 你确实想要Dan
Uh, no, you don't want me, sir. You do want Dan.

440
00:19:27,913 --> 00:19:29,547
他很棒 我马上就会有个大回弹
- He's great. - I've got a big bounce coming on.

442
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:32,684
不 唔唔 你不能带走Mike
<i>No, uh-uh, you can't take Mike.</i>

443
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:34,585
他是我的传媒主管
He's my director of communications.

444
00:19:34,586 --> 00:19:36,754
你在开玩笑?你不能带走他
Are you kidding me? You can't have him.

445
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:40,891
总统的欧洲访问 赫尔辛基协议...
POTUS's European visit, the Helsinki agreement...

446
00:19:40,892 --> 00:19:43,461
哦? 他没法去了
Yeah? - He Can No longer Make it.

447
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:46,631
债务上限谈话马上就要崩了
Debt ceiling talks are on the verge of collapse,

448
00:19:46,632 --> 00:19:48,566
所以他需要有人代他去
so he needs someone to go in his place.

449
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:51,669
现在要么是国务卿要么...
Now either that's the Secretary of State or...

450
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,610
Mike 再三考虑后
Mike, on second thought,

451
00:19:59,611 --> 00:20:03,047
我认为这整个梦...
I think that this whole Dream...

452
00:20:03,048 --> 00:20:04,448
统计 统计

统计梦什么的听起来似乎不错
Dream Metric thing sounds kind of fantastic.

454
00:20:08,286 --> 00:20:11,121
你不这样认为吗 是的 女士
- Don't you think? - Yes, ma'am.

455
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:12,556
总统下达的命令 那么...

461
00:20:22,533 --> 00:20:25,502
唔 等等 你在说什么
Uh, wait. What are you talking about?

462
00:20:25,503 --> 00:20:28,305
你要把我的传媒主管带走
You're taking my director of communications

463
00:20:28,306 --> 00:20:30,107
然后给我Jonah?
<i>and you're giving me Jonah?</i>

464
00:20:30,108 --> 00:20:32,175
这是总统的指示
This comes from POTUS.

465
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:36,313
女士 女士 请不要让他带走我
Ma'am. Ma'am, please don't let him take me.

466
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:37,848
我不要去数字营
I don't want to go to numbers camp.

467

469
00:20:41,652 --> 00:20:44,021
很明显你给Kent留下了好印象
Obviously you made an impression on Kent.

470
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:45,622
我不留印象的 女士
I don't make impressions, ma'am.

471
00:20:45,623 --> 00:20:48,525
我真的有过室友坚持我不存在的经历
I've literally lived with people who insist I was never there.

472
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:49,993
你不做任何媒体简介 明白吗
You give no press briefings. Understood?

473
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:52,629
我会是Mike 你会是丑陋的我
I become Mike, you become an ugly me.

474
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:54,498
酷 我可以搞定新媒体

Reddit  Tumblr 没问题
Reddit, Tumblr, boom.

477
00:20:59,004 --> 00:21:02,240
什么都行 只要你别用我在空军二号上的卫生间
Whatever. Just don't use my bathroom on Air Force Two.

478
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,141
那有另外一个卫生间吗? 欧洲
<i>- There's another bathroom? - Europe!</i>

479
00:21:04,142 --> 00:21:06,710
哦 我的天哪(法语) 没错 我知道 那会非常有意思
<i>- Oh, mon dieu. - Yeah, I know. It's gonna be fun.</i>

480
00:21:06,711 --> 00:21:08,779
真的 真的很有趣 那会很有趣
- Really, really fun. - It'll be really fun.

481
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,883
现在 我很抱歉 但我不认为 我们能和Dana一起吃晚餐了
Now, I'm so sorry, but I don't think we're gonna be able to do the dinner with Dana.

482
00:21:11,884 --> 00:21:15,353
哦 我们可以提前到午餐 就那么办
Oh, we can bring it forward to lunch. Let's do that.

483
00:21:15,354 --> 00:21:17,255

哦 是的 好吧 嗯? 嗯? 好吧
Oh. Yeah. Okay. - Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

485
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:27,799
那么就说我要做进口佩科里诺干酪的生意的事
So cut to I'd set up a business importing pecorino cheese.

486
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,568
你知道那个牌子的的奶酪吗
<i>Are you familiar with that brand of cheese?</i>

487
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:32,437
唔 我认为... 它和巴马干酪很像 但还是不同
- Uh, I think... - It's like parmesan, but it's different.

488
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,841
它们非常不一样 你用来形容...的词是?
- They're very different. - What's the word that you use to describe...

489
00:21:35,842 --> 00:21:39,344
微黑 微黑
a duskiness. - a duskiness.

490
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:42,880
那不是很棒吗? 你会用微黑来形容过奶酪吗?
Isn't that great? Would you ever describe a cheese as dusky?

491
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:45,816
打死也不会 没有 我不会那么做
Not in a million years, no. I wouldn't do that.

492
00:21:45,817 --> 00:21:50,120
但是...那么你进口巴马干酪?
But so... so you import parmesan?

493
00:21:50,121 --> 00:21:51,989
佩科里诺 抱歉 佩科里诺
- Pecorino. - I'm sorry, the pecorino.

494
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,324
直接从意大利托斯卡纳进口
They're direct from Tuscany,

495
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,692
也就是说它们途经佛罗伦萨
so that means it comes in through Florence.

496
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:59,129
如果我用了西西里的供应商的话--事实上我不会
If I were to use a Sicilian supplier, which I wouldn't,

497
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:00,497
我的运营费用就会加倍
my overheads would double.

498
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:02,266
他们就会给她一个
And they would have made her an offer

499
00:22:02,267 --> 00:22:04,034
她无法拒绝的价格
that she couldn't refuse.

500
00:22:04,035 --> 00:22:06,736
实际上 黑手党极少插手奶制品业
Actually, the mafia involvement in the dairy industry is minimal.

501
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:08,538
你是对的 我很抱歉 我不该这么多嘴
You're right. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be flippant.

502
00:22:08,539 --> 00:22:10,841
想想吧 在《教父》里 没有奶酪
Think about it. In The Godfather, no cheese.

503
00:22:10,842 --> 00:22:13,577
是 你说的对 你知道我是对的
- Yeah, you're right. - You know I'm right.

504
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:15,778
砰! 那是她的标语
- Boom! - That's her catchphrase.

505
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:18,214
她抓到你了 你得小心
She got you. You got to be so careful.

506
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:20,349
好吧
Okay.

507

510
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:33,028

00:22:33,029 --> 00:22:36,197
我想说谢谢
And I want to say thank you

512
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:39,533
为你替我所做的一切

513
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,535

它的设计是不是一样的 亲爱的?
Does it have the same layout, honey?

521
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,054
因为让你去熟悉另一个那会花很长的时间
<i>Because it took you so long to learn the other one.</i>

522
00:23:02,055 --> 00:23:04,190
不 这很好 我可以学一个新的设计 没问题
No, it's fine. I can learn a new layout. It's fine.

你需要做的就是关掉无线网络
You know what you got to do is shut the Wi-Fi off.

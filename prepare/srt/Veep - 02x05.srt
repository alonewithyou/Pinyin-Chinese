1
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,042
那只是首在非正式活动中唱的好玩的歌而已
It was a lighthearted song at an informal event.

2
00:00:22,043 --> 00:00:23,578
是的 她会向欧洲道歉
Yeah, she's going to apologize to Europe

3
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,980
因为它几乎和黑死病
'cause it's right up there with the bubonic plague

4
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,283
还有德累斯顿地毯式轰炸一样臭名昭著了
and the carpet bombing at Dresden.

5
00:00:28,284 --> 00:00:31,187
Tommy 你好 Amy 是的
Tommy, hi. Amy. Yeah.

6
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:33,056
别理Dan 他内分泌失调
Ignore Dan. He's hormonal.

7
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:35,225
这首歌有趣是因为
The song is funny because

8
00:00:35,226 --> 00:00:37,027
它恰好和她对欧洲的观点相反
it's the opposite of her views on Europe.

9
00:00:37,028 --> 00:00:39,862
等我回来一起去喝一杯?没问题
Drinks when I get back? Okay.

哦 我可不想变成Mike 好吗

12
00:00:43,362 --> 00:00:44,829
就是Mike也不想是Mike
Even Mike doesn't want to be like Mike.

13
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,230
你需要打电话给他
<i>You should call him.</i>

14
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,396
我们得让副总统远离一般人
And we need to keep the veep away from regular people

15
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:49,930
以及他们奇怪的问题
and their awkward questions.

16
00:00:49,931 --> 00:00:51,631
所以要让她身在赫尔辛基而不真在赫尔辛基
So while she's in Helsinki, just keep her out of Helsinki.

17
00:00:51,632 --> 00:00:54,967
哦 棒极了 她给了我一个口袋更少的Leviathan包
- Yeah, wonderful. - She gave me a Leviathan with fewer pockets.

18
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:59,099
那么最新消息是什么?巴尔干半岛上有人焚烧我的肖像?
So what's the latest? Any burning effigies of me in the Balkans?

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,359
瞧你穿着睡衣的样子 我需要唑吡旦 (治疗短期失眠)
Look at You in your jammies. - I need Ambien.

20
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,860

22
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:09,395

23
00:01:09,396 --> 00:01:11,194

别摆出那副表情
Please don't make that face.

32
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,601
你知道我只在出国的时候才干这个 给我吧
You know I only do this when I go abroad. Come on.

33
00:01:30,602 --> 00:01:33,336
只是上次你戒烟的时候 你情绪起伏很大
It's just last time you stopped, you were so up and down.

听着 我确实非常需要我的小卫士们

有报纸称您是来自特区的恐欧女头领
Some paper is calling you the Europhobic Khaleesi from DC.

39
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:50,484
恐欧? 不是吧?
Europhobic? Seriously?

40
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,120
那是什么意思? 我害怕说话打字幕么?
What is that supposed to mean? I'm scared of subtitles?

41
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:58,791
Mike 你拿到

- How's it hanging, Mike? - It's fucking insane here.

47
00:02:11,303 --> 00:02:13,770
就像在数学监狱一样 他们用数字强暴你
It's like a math prison. They rape you with numbers.

48
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:15,672

- Oh, come on. - It's a small bag.

141
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:15,669
你在抱怨这个礼物? 不 我没有
- Are you complaining about this gift? - No, I'm not.

142
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,405
这包不小 你手太大了
It's not a small bag. Your hands are large.

143
00:06:18,406 --> 00:06:21,108
我爸总说我有双女人的手 好吧...
- My dad always said I had lady's hands. - Well...

144
00:06:21,109 --> 00:06:23,176
我拿到了 哦 好家伙
- I got 'em. - Oh, goodie.

145
00:06:23,177 --> 00:06:25,813
就这里 没错 我觉得太爽了
Right here. - Yep. I feel so nasty.

146
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:32,619
Wow.

147
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,389
别摆那张贵格教徒进了脱衣舞俱乐部的表情
Don't give me that Quaker in a titty bar look.

148
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:37,358
我说真的 别 (严守清规的基督教派别)
Seriously, don't.

149
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,262
好啦...Ken给芭比套上了衬裙 (说错话) (Ken是芭比的官配男友)
<i>Here we go... Ken's given Barbie the slip.</i>

150
00:06:41,263 --> 00:06:42,764
好吧 伙计们
<i>Okay, guys,</i>

151
00:06:42,765 --> 00:06:45,566
向那些可能误解了那首歌的人
to those who may have misinterpreted the song,

152
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:47,068
我们向他们表示歉意
we, to them, offer apologies,

153
00:06:47,069 --> 00:06:49,604
尤其是我们最亲切的东道主
especially our most gracious host

154
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:51,906
芬兰总理
the Prime Minister of Finland.

155
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:53,141
那里发生了什么?
So what's going on back there?

156
00:06:53,142 --> 00:06:55,009
我只知道国防部长
<i>All I know is the Secretary of Defense</i>

157
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,444
去见了Kent
has been in to see Kent.

158
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:58,145
我得去睡了 Amy
<i>I must go to sleep now, Amy.</i>

159
00:06:58,146 --> 00:07:00,581
我的时差和你一样...被赫尔辛基化了
I'm on your time... Helsinchronized.

160
00:07:00,582 --> 00:07:03,551
哦 好吧 我觉得我同时呆在了两个时区
Yeah, well, I feel like I'm on two time zones at the same time.

161
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,619
我或许是第一个来平行大姨妈的女人
I might be the first woman ever to have parallel periods.

162
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:08,189
你得去欧洲时区 Amy 而我在我的卧室里
You got to go to Europe, Amy, and I'm in my bedroom.

163
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,025
Sean 你得上床了
Sean, you need to come to bed now.

164
00:07:11,026 --> 00:07:14,829
别想太多 我们只是睡觉而已
And lower your expectations. We will just be sleeping.

165
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,232
这不是次危机
It's not a crisis. Despite your standard-issue

166
00:07:18,233 --> 00:07:21,001
不计较你常规的歇斯底里的洗衣妇反应 这确实不是...
hysterical washerwoman reaction, it's really not.

167
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:22,937
生命正受到威胁 你知道生命对吧?
Lives were at risk. You know lives?

168
00:07:22,938 --> 00:07:25,106
在你变成亡灵之王前你曾经拥有的
Like what you had before they made you king of the undead.

169
00:07:25,107 --> 00:07:28,977
你对危机管理的认知就是尖叫 我们完了! 埋了我!
Your idea of crisis management is screaming, We're fucked! Bury me!

170
00:07:28,978 --> 00:07:31,212
我们完了! 埋了我!
We're fucked! Bury me!

171
00:07:36,619 --> 00:07:39,554
好吧 这是Hyva Suomi 就是上 芬兰 Hyva Suomi
<i>Okay, it's Hyva Suomi. That's Go, Finland.</i>

172
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:43,391
好吧 Hyva Suomi 那首歌的事情过去了吗?
Okay, Hyva Suomi. And is the song thing shut down?

173
00:07:43,392 --> 00:07:45,093
哦 是的 头部中弹 无影无踪
Oh, yeah. Bullet in the head, unmarked grave.

174
00:07:45,094 --> 00:07:46,962
副总统女士

175
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:49,598
总理女士

谢谢 请叫我Selina

178
00:07:54,104 --> 00:07:56,638
Selina 什么?
Selina. - Yes?

179
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,241
抱歉? 什么?
Excuse me? - What?

180
00:07:59,242 --> 00:08:01,944
我们可以开始了吗 哦 是的 是的
- Shall we begin? - Oh, yes. Yes.

181
00:08:01,945 --> 00:08:04,113
您愿意领路么 是的 是的
- Would you like to lead the way? - Yes, yes.

182
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:05,915
哦 您愿意先行吗? 哦 我们可以...

一起走?好吗? 一前一后

184

是吗?是吗? 我们得走了
Yes? Yes? - We Shall go.

185
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,354
我为您准备了一份礼物

00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:15,591
我们希望当您来我们国家的时候 您会去钓鱼
We hope that when you come to our country, you will go fishing.

187
00:08:15,592 --> 00:08:17,793
因为没人会招待我?
Because no one will feed me?

188
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:20,495
因为您喜爱钓鱼
Because you love fishing.

189
00:08:20,496 --> 00:08:23,097
实际上 并不 真令人困惑
I don't, actually. How baffling.

190
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:26,067
不 但这仍是份漂亮的礼物
No, but it is still a beautiful gift.

191
00:08:26,068 --> 00:08:28,469
我同样有份
I also have a gift for you

192
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,005
著名芬兰鸟的礼物给您
of famous Finnish birds.

193
00:08:31,006 --> 00:08:33,141
哦 哦 天哪
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

194
00:08:33,142 --> 00:08:35,710
哦 天哪
Oh, my.

195
00:08:35,711 --> 00:08:37,445
哦 我可以 我可以 谢谢
Oh, I have it. I have it.

196
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:39,313
真是一只漂亮的钟
Thank you. What a lovely clock

197
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:42,383
上面还有只...特殊的鸟儿
with an unusual bird.

198
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:44,385
这是愤怒的小鸟
It's an Angry Bird.

199
00:08:44,386 --> 00:08:47,421
它为什么那么愤怒?
And why is it so angry?

200
00:08:47,422 --> 00:08:51,825
因为它要摧毁所有的猪
Because it wants to destroy all of the pigs.

201
00:08:51,826 --> 00:08:55,162
哦 当然 它是只愤怒的小鸟
Oh, of course. It's an Angry Bird.

202
00:08:55,163 --> 00:08:56,897
那是个应用 电脑游戏
It is an app. It is a computer game.

203
00:08:56,898 --> 00:08:59,233
这是我们送给您的一个成功的芬兰输出产品
It is a successful Finnish export

204
00:08:59,234 --> 00:09:02,536
它反映了芬兰
that we give to you to reflect Finland's place

205
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:05,606
作为软件创新先锋的地位
as a pioneer of software innovation.

206
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:07,274
确实 我很迷它
Indeed. I'm a huge fan.

207
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,476
您玩过? 当然 当然
You have played it? - Yes. Yes.

208
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:13,413
尽管游戏中的暴力是个问题
Although violence in games is a concern.

209
00:09:13,414 --> 00:09:16,549
但在这里
But in this case, it's great fun

210
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:19,051
在游戏里干掉所有的猪实在是很有意思
to kill the pigs

211
00:09:19,052 --> 00:09:21,453
(大段芬兰语...)
in a game, of course.

212
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,501
题记... 嗯?
the inscription... - Yes?

213
00:09:36,502 --> 00:09:39,337
是的 它说
Yes, it reads, Finland,

214
00:09:39,338 --> 00:09:42,575
芬兰 你笨重而庞大
you are hefty.

215
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:45,344
唔嗯 这个词有误
Uh-uh. That is the wrong word.

216
00:09:45,345 --> 00:09:47,780
哦 当然 很讽刺 不是吗?
Oh. Yes, it is ironic, no?

217
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:52,585
因为美国人的体重指数比芬兰人的高得多
Because Americans have a much greater body mass index than the Finns.

218
00:09:52,586 --> 00:09:55,054
啊 那就是我最近发起
Ah, which is why I have recently launched

219
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,324
“动起来”运动的原因
my Get Moving campaign,

220
00:09:57,325 --> 00:10:01,461
它专门针对肥胖
which is aimed specifically at the obese

221
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:04,565
以及病态肥胖
and the morbidly obese.

222
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:08,968
你为何如此厌恶数字?
Why do you hate numbers so much?

223
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:12,639
哦 上帝啊 你没被你数学老师骚扰过 对吗
Oh, God, you weren't molested by your math teacher, were you?

224
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,708
到这里面来 哦
Let's go in here. Oh.

225
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:16,743
嘿 Mike 呃...
- Hey, Mike. - Uh...

226
00:10:19,347 --> 00:10:21,315
你好 Kent 我们有个问题 Mike
- Hi, Kent. - We have a problem, Mike.

227
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,517
我会尽快给你统计总结 先生
I'm gonna get you the stat summary ASAP, sir.

228
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:25,018
我是统计织梦者
I am a Metric Dreamweaver.

229
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,087
这和统计梦没关系
This is not a Dream Metric issue.

230
00:10:27,088 --> 00:10:29,189
你知道索伦之眼吗?
Are you familiar with the Eye of Sauron?

231
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,558
能见一切之眼
Fire-rimmed, all-seeing eye

232
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,360
托尔金的《魔戒》里以火为界
from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.

233
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:35,629
我想我某次在飞机上听过
I think I caught it on a plane once.

234
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:39,332
索伦之眼眼几乎完美地体现了当代媒体的特点
The Eye of Sauron is the near perfect analogue for the modern media.

235
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,801
如果我们能把那眼睛导向赫尔辛基
If we can draw the Eye to Helsinki,

236
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:44,670
那么没人会关心这儿发生了什么
then it won't be looking at what's going on here.

237
00:10:44,671 --> 00:10:47,473
那么这儿到底发生了什么?
And what is exactly going on here?

238
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,341
我可没法告诉你 Mike
I cannot tell you that, Mike.

239
00:10:49,342 --> 00:10:50,709
那Selina是咕噜姆(《魔戒》中的怪物)
Is Selina Gollum?

240
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:53,679
不 不 不 听够那些废料了
No, no, no. Enough of that ear swill.

241
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,582
现在发生了我认为在发生的事情吗 Kent?
Is what's going on what I think is going on, Kent?

242
00:10:56,583 --> 00:10:58,017
你现在在当衣帽间服务小妹了?
Are you working as a hatcheck girl now?

243
00:10:58,018 --> 00:11:00,452
哦 棒极了 你看到了吗
Oh, great. Did you see that?

244
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:02,121
那是他妈的司法部长
The Attorney fucking General.

245
00:11:02,122 --> 00:11:05,825
瞧 我们都知道谎言比犯罪更糟糕
Look, we all know that the lie is worse than the crime.

246
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:07,593
瞧 你正点头
Look, you're nodding your head,

247
00:11:07,594 --> 00:11:09,395
但你不知道他妈的我在说什么
but you don't know what the fuck I'm talking about.

248
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:12,231
那首歌 它 捂住耳朵 Mike
- The song, it's... - Close your ears, Mike.

249
00:11:12,232 --> 00:11:15,534
乌兹别克斯坦的其中一个人质是间谍
One of the hostages in Uzbekistan was a spy.

250
00:11:15,535 --> 00:11:19,472
现在 有人知情 但是完全没打算通知国会
Now, some people knew and didn't bother to inform Congress.

251
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:21,808
其他人 比如Selina 则被蒙在鼓里
Other people, like Selina, did not know.

252
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:24,544
她曾公开否认有间谍
She went on record denying that there was a spy.

253
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,713
那么在未来的13个月里
So for the next 13 months,

254
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:28,781
我们就会一直玩谁什么时候知道了什么事
we're gonna play who knew what when.

255
00:11:28,782 --> 00:11:31,317
然后我们当中的某些人就得下岗去做巡回演说
Then some of us are gonna go off on the lecture circuit

256
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:33,853
另一些会直接进监狱
and some of us are gonna go off to prison.

257
00:11:33,854 --> 00:11:36,189
现在你可以摇头了
Now you can shake your head.

258
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:38,491
苍天啊 我讨厌了解内幕
Christ, I hate knowledge.

259
00:11:38,492 --> 00:11:41,461
请允许我介绍我的丈夫
May I introduce, please, my husband?

260
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:43,029
Osmo Hakkinen.

261
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,065
你好
How do you do?

262
00:11:45,066 --> 00:11:47,634
哦 真可心
Oh! How lovely.

263
00:11:47,635 --> 00:11:50,204
自1835年以后华盛顿就不再这么做了
That hasn't happened in Washington since 1835.

264
00:11:50,205 --> 00:11:51,972
很荣幸见到您
It is a pleasure to meet you.

265
00:11:51,973 --> 00:11:55,008
尽管您没有高歌一曲让我有些失望
Although I'm a little bit disappointed you've not serenaded us.

266
00:11:55,009 --> 00:11:56,410
哦 那首歌
Ah, the song.

267
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:59,046
哦 我希望您能明白那完全是开玩笑的
Well, I hope you realize that that was entirely in jest.

268
00:11:59,047 --> 00:12:01,815
是的 事实上 是那个我被冒犯了的推测
Yes. In fact, it is the presumption of offense

269
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:03,450
冒犯了我
that has offended me.

270
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:06,053
哦 好吧 我们无意冒犯
Oh, well, no offense was intended.

271
00:12:06,054 --> 00:12:09,655
但你的传媒主管有专门向我道歉
But your communications director apologized specifically to me.

272
00:12:09,656 --> 00:12:13,360
这让人觉得我大概缺乏幽默感或者狭隘 我是个下等人 (nieder 德语)
This gives the impression that I am somehow humorless or petty. I am neider.

273
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:15,362
她是下等人 不 她是下等人
- She is neider. - No, she's neider.

274
00:12:15,363 --> 00:12:17,898
能失陪一小会么?
Would you please excuse us for just one moment?

275
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:20,601
嗯? 就一会 嗯
- Yes? - For a moment, yeah.

276
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:24,739
那首歌
So that song, unlike your career

277
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:27,642
和你传媒主管的职业生涯不同 它还不会完
as communications director, will not die.

278
00:12:27,643 --> 00:12:31,379
所以现在你得去为这个道歉而道歉
So now you must go and apologize for the apology.

279
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:35,250
是的 女士 那你为什么还站在这?
- Yes, ma'am. - Why are you still standing right here?

280
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,519
哦 他来了 维珍(处男)大西洋
Oh, here he comes. Virgin Atlantic.

281
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,889
好吧 伙计们
Okay, guys, I want to apologize

282
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,793
我想为之前暗示
for suggesting that the prime minister

他什么? 他他妈的做了什么?
He What? - He fucking What?

431
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:42,119
你告诉她了吗 他...他...
did You tell her? - He... He...

432
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,454
他告诉我那些谣言不是真的
he told me those rumors weren't true.

433
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,589
你能相信那个怪物么
Can you believe that monster?

434
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:49,024
等等 等等 等等 发生了什么 你说了什么
- Wait, wait, wait. What happened? - What did you say?

435
00:18:49,025 --> 00:18:50,459
总统 他猥亵了她
POTUS. - He groped her.

436
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,294
总统猥亵了你? 不是
POTUS groped you? - No.

437
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:53,862
总统没那个种来猥亵我
POTUS wouldn't have the balls to grope me.

438
00:18:53,863 --> 00:18:55,931
他知道他说了谎?
He knew and he lied?

439
00:18:55,932 --> 00:18:57,866
等等 等等 知道什么?对什么说谎?
Wait, wait, knew what? Lied about what?

440
00:18:57,867 --> 00:19:00,402
总统知道那个学生是间谍
POTUS knew that the student was a spy

441
00:19:00,403 --> 00:19:02,905
并且没有通知国会的情报委员会
and didn't inform the Congressional Intel Committee.

442
00:19:02,906 --> 00:19:05,608
去他的!去他的! 你们刚才说什么?
- Shit! Shit! - What were you talking about?

443
00:19:05,609 --> 00:19:08,545
Osmo猥亵了我
Osmo groped me.

444
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:09,712
去他的!
Shit!

445
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,981
我们要
We need to rain down the full might

446
00:19:11,982 --> 00:19:13,983
把核武库的全部火力倾向芬兰
of our nuclear arsenal on Finland.

447
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,819
Mm-hmm.

448
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,021
这就是另一件我忘记告诉你的事情
That's the other thing I forgot to tell you.

449
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,691
我们要炸平芬兰
We're gonna blow up Finland.

450
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,526
我能为您做什么? 他妈的你去哪了?
Can I help you? Where the fuck you been?

451
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,361
别跟我说 你一直在做民调
<i>Don't tell me. You've been polling.</i>

452
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:27,298
我敢说你就算拉泡屎 出来形状都是数字2 (大便的俚语)
I bet when you take a crap, it actually comes out as a number two.

453
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:29,901
听着 我们得告诉总统
Listen, we've got to tell the president

454
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:31,870
他必须承认那个学生是间谍
that he has to admit that this student was a spy.

455
00:19:31,871 --> 00:19:34,706
我仍在做对照 看是否承认是最好的路线
I'm still collating whether admitting is the best course.

456
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,142
我不敢相信你居然还在核对那他妈的风向
I can't believe you're still checking the fucking wind direction.

457
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:40,512
我需要更多的时间 在真相显现在此种...
I need more time before the truth can emerge in such a...

458
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,205
Furlong众议员
Congressman Furlong.

459
00:19:42,206 --> 00:19:44,075
嗯 沉默看起来在这行不通
Yeah, the blank looks are not gonna play here.

460
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:46,218
你们两个被抓到和祖母口交
You two have been caught with your balls in grandma's mouth.

461
00:19:46,219 --> 00:19:47,820
每个人都在高调地谈论这个
Everybody's talking about it up on the Hill.

462
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,422
我知道我所知道的
I know what I know.

463
00:19:49,423 --> 00:19:52,091
我不知道你认为你知道的
I don't know what you think you know.

464
00:19:52,092 --> 00:19:54,894
去你妈的还有你那孔子门徒狗屎 成吗
Screw you and your Confucius grasshopper bullshit, all right?

465
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:58,097
每个人都会知道 这种事情最后都会朝那个方向发展
Everybody's gonna know. That's just the way these things go.

466
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:01,267
现在人们认为总统对那个孩子是间谍的事情撒了谎
Now people think POTUS lied about that kid being a spy.

467
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:04,970
我想知道你们这两个喜欢吞精液的瘾君子 有什么可行性建议
I want to know what you two spunk junkies propose we do about it.

468
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:07,906
抱歉 Kent 我就是有个小问题 是关于...
Sorry, Kent, I just had a quick question about...

469
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:10,676
哦 他们都知道了?Laurel和二货? (出自Laurel和Hardy 滑稽片搭档)
Oh, do they know? Laurel and Retardy?

470
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,345
我跟你说 Mike 我要你把这些总结加到那个发布概述里
Tell you what, Mike. I need you to add these summaries

471
00:20:13,346 --> 00:20:17,115
好吗?去
to the rollout overview. Okay? Go.

472
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:19,184
哦 第二轮 好吧...
- Oh, round two. - Well...

473
00:20:19,185 --> 00:20:20,986
Doyle参议员 先生们 先生们

474
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,822
哦 我希望我能得到我的五杯免费酒
Well, I hope I get my five free punches.

475
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,425
我是他妈的参议院情报委员会的主席
I'm the fucking chair of Senate Intel,

476
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:30,228
也就是说我本该被告知一切秘密行动
which means that I'm supposed to be informed of any covert action.

477
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,163
我们在同一条船上 好吗?
We're all on the same team here, right?

478
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:35,199
没错 一团糟号 哦 我的会员卡就在这的某个地方
Right, Team Fuckup. Yeah, I got my membership card here somewhere.

479
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,935
我找不到它 你得有大局观
- I can't find it. - You need to look at the bigger picture.

480
00:20:36,936 --> 00:20:38,436
哦 我看到了大局
Oh, I've seen the bigger picture.

481
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,572
显示总统对美国人民说谎
Shows POTUS lying to the American people.

482
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,908
我告诉你 这不只是个危机
I'm telling you, this is not just a crisis.

483
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:46,778
这至少能让Oliver Stone拍十年电影 (导演 热爱政治题材)
This is at least 10 years of Oliver Stone movies.

484
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:48,546
没错 不是那些好的 不是《野战排》那种
Yeah, not the good ones. Not Platoon.

485
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,348
我说 你他妈的到底哪儿不对劲 Kent?
<i>What the fuck is wrong with you, Kent?</i>

486
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:54,986
说真的 当你拔出引线 你就该扔出手榴弹了
Seriously, when you pulled the pin out, you're supposed to throw the grenade away.

487
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,188
你不会把它黏在你那该死的屁股上
You don't stick it up your own freakin' ass.

488
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,123
那是我喜闻乐见的
That I'd like to see.

489
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,825
我需要根香烟 哦 上帝啊
- I need a cigarette. - Oh, God.

490
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,861
不 不是哦 上帝啊  给我该死的香烟
No, not Oh, God. Just get me the goddamn cigarette.

491
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,631
总统 我所支持的
The president, the one I support,

492
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:09,334
那个因工作我为之效忠的总统
the one that I am loyal to

493
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,802
对我说了谎
as my job, lies to me.

494
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,538
对吗? 唔嗯
<i>- Right? - Mm-hmm.</i>

495
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,708
好吧 在我为道歉而道歉后
Okay, after I apologized for apologizing,

496
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,877
我之前已经开始把那些活动重新塞回你的日程表
I started to put meet-the-people events back in your schedule.

497
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,979
全部取消并为此道歉
Cancel them all and apologize for cancelling.

498
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,048
哦 上帝啊 还要道歉?真的?
Oh, Jesus, more apologizing? Really?

499
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,385
I apologized less after I banged my brother's fianc閑.
我搞上我兄弟的未婚妻我都没这么道歉过

500
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,353
你在埋怨什么?你在开玩笑呢?
What are you bitching about? Are you kidding?

501
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:32,523
我才是那个压力重重的人 振作起来 女士
I'm the one who's under pressure. Get it together, lady.

502
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:36,026
那猥亵呢? 我说 来吧
What about the grope? I mean, come on.

503
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:39,129
谢谢 那是对美国的袭击
Thank you. - that is an attack on America.

504
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:43,166
好吗?在我看来那可以算是一次性骚扰中的911
All right? That's like a sexual 9/11 in my opinion.

505
00:21:43,167 --> 00:21:46,769
或者至少是个古巴导弹危机级别的性骚扰
Or a sexual Cuban Missile Crisis at the least.

506
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:49,172
我们不可能对众公开这次猥亵
It's not like we can go public about the grope.

507
00:21:49,173 --> 00:21:51,073
那会给你定性 没错
it Would define you. - Right.

508
00:21:51,074 --> 00:21:52,975
你的乳房被个芬兰人
Your tit being fondled by a Finn

509
00:21:52,976 --> 00:21:54,510
揉捏了会是唯一被记住的
would be all you're remembered for.

510
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:57,013
没错 你不能为此树立个雕像
- Yeah. - You can't build a statue on that.

511
00:21:57,014 --> 00:22:00,350
没错 没人可以知道这个
That's right. Nobody can know about this.

512
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,953
好吗?尤其是Kent 哦 没错
- All right? Especially Kent. - Oh, yeah.

513
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:05,056
为什么要那么做?因为他会用此来针对我
And why is that? Because he's gonna use it against me.

514
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:06,758
猥亵局势图 没错
a grope matrix. - Right.

515
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:09,995
因为他是个男人
Because he's a man.

516
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:14,066
因为我们生活在一个男人主宰的世界
Because this is a man's world that we live in.

517
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:19,238
因为阴茎轴心
Because of the axis of dick.

518
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:33,386
这鱼很美味
This fish is delicious.

519
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,855
这是什么鱼? 这是鸡肉
What is this fish? - it is chicken.

520
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:37,924
鸡胸肉? 是的
the breast? - Yes.

521
00:22:37,925 --> 00:22:42,462
在美国 实际上 我们称鱼肉是海洋里的鸡肉
In America we actually call fish chicken of the sea.

522
00:22:42,463 --> 00:22:44,431
我喜欢鱼肉
I love fish.

523
00:22:44,432 --> 00:22:46,400
有些人不喜欢它的味道
Some men do not like the taste.

524
00:22:46,401 --> 00:22:49,003
我喜欢
I do.

525
00:22:50,939 --> 00:22:53,274
谢谢 哦 总理女士
Thank you. Oh, Madam Prime Minister,

526
00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:56,411
我还没向您介绍Gary Walsh
I don't believe I've had a chance to introduce you to Gary Walsh.

527
00:22:56,412 --> 00:22:58,580
不 不 你还没有
No. No, you have not.

528
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,114
我是副总统的拎包人
I'm the VP's bag man,

529
00:23:00,115 --> 00:23:02,817
那个我想在芬兰你们叫kassi
which I believe in Finland you say kassi.

530
00:23:02,818 --> 00:23:06,487
抱歉? 我是个kassi
- Excuse me? - I'm a kassi.

531
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,193
你从哪知道的那个翻译?
Where did you get this translation from?

532
00:23:12,194 --> 00:23:15,029
我在特区有个在使馆工作的芬兰朋友
I have a Finnish friend in DC who works at the embassy

533
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,566
在我来之前她教了我一些
and she gave me lessons before I came.

534
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:20,168
如你所知 kassi是包的意思
You see, kassi is bag,

535
00:23:20,169 --> 00:23:23,238
但不是拎包人
but it's not bag man.

536
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:25,941
那是男人的袋子 你知道的 那个
It is a man bag. You know, rrr.

537
00:23:25,942 --> 00:23:27,676
那是个容器
It is a container.

538
00:23:27,677 --> 00:23:30,211
装睾丸的容器
It is a testicle container.

539
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:34,316
哦 不 别觉得羞耻 Gary
Oh, no. Don't feel ashamed, Gary.

540
00:23:34,317 --> 00:23:36,952
因为 当然 你不是阴囊什么的
Because, of course, you're not a ball sack.

541
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:39,054
而且不是每个人能说自己不是...
And not everyone can say that they're not...

542
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:40,956
我很抱歉这么说…
excuse me, I'm so sorry...

543
00:23:40,957 --> 00:23:42,591
阴囊
a ball sack.

544
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,694
甚至这张桌子上的每个人也不是都能说
Not even everyone at this very table.

545
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:49,464
Kent希望我把U盘里的地区总结加进去
Kent wants me to add these regional summaries

546
00:23:49,465 --> 00:23:51,867
好了 你怎么加的?
from the thumb drive. All right, how do you add?

547
00:23:51,868 --> 00:23:53,468
command键加A  Alt加Break (苹果键盘)
Command A, hombre.

548
00:23:53,469 --> 00:23:55,103
我还以为是ctrl a
I always thought it was control A.

549
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:58,239
好吧 成了 发送
Okay, here we go. Send.

550
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,108
我去 或许就是Ctrl A
Shit, maybe it was control A.

551
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:03,177
我想你大概选择了全部
I think you might have selected all

552
00:24:03,178 --> 00:24:05,146
把那个U盘里的所有资料全发出去了
and sent everything that was on that thumb drive.

553
00:24:05,147 --> 00:24:07,414
那是你告诉我的 不 我没有
- That's what you told me to do. - No, I didn't.

554
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:09,550
你说了command a 不 我说的是Ctrl a
- You said command A. - No, I said control A.

555
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:11,886
你只是没有听清楚 因为你没戴上助听器
You just couldn't hear me because you didn't have your ear trumpet.

556
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,024
我觉得我要把这个毁尸灭迹 我能烧掉这台电脑吗?
I feel like I want to burn this thing. Can I burn this computer?

557
00:24:16,025 --> 00:24:18,126
你为什么要烧那个 Mike?
Why would you burn that, Mike?

558
00:24:20,263 --> 00:24:22,465
Mike?抱歉
Mike? Excuse me.

559
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,435
怎么了?
What's up?

560
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:28,471
我们刚把Kent关于那个间谍的民调分析发了出去
We just sent out Kent's polling consultation on the spy.

561
00:24:28,472 --> 00:24:29,672
什么间谍?
What spy?

562
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:31,708
人质中有一个是间谍
One of the hostages was a spy.

563
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,911
哦 去你妈的 Mike
Oh, fuck you, Mike.

564
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:37,180
你就是事业毒药 你知道吗?
You're career poison. Do you know that?

565
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:40,149
上帝啊 那就是你为什么喜欢玩帆船的原因 因为你他妈的就是个锚
Jesus, that's why you like sailing, because you're a fucking anchor

566
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,985
把有着光明前途的事业拖到他妈的海底
dragging promising careers down to the bottom of the fucking ocean.

567
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,622
停 这只是阶段一的东西
Stop it. This was just phase one stuff.

568
00:24:45,623 --> 00:24:47,657
范例问题大概像是如果总统说了谎怎么办?这种
Sample questions like, What if the president lied?

569
00:24:47,658 --> 00:24:49,726
但还不是那个 那个听起来很糟

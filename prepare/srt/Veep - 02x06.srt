5
00:00:27,966 --> 00:00:30,134
她的欧洲访问是否被那首歌的阴影笼罩?
Wasn't her trip to Europe overshadowed by the song?

6
00:00:30,168 --> 00:00:31,868
你知道的 就是那首她嘲笑欧洲人的歌
You know, the one where she mocked Europeans?

7
00:00:31,902 --> 00:00:33,502
她没有嘲笑欧洲人
<i>She wasn't mocking Europeans.</i>

8
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:35,337
我会说那首歌很搞笑 搞笑?
- I would say the song was jesty. - <i>Jesty?</i>

9
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:37,173
但更重要的是 现在副总统

正与国会多数党领袖Mary King会晤

00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:43,079
能避免政府停工的债务削减

13
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:44,781
Selina Meyer将成为美国史上

14
00:00:44,815 --> 00:00:47,383
最有效率的副总统之一
effective American vice presidents in history.

15
00:00:47,417 --> 00:00:50,185
在解救乌兹别克斯坦人质事件中她起了关键性的作用
She was crucial in the freeing of the Uzbekistan hostages.

16
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:52,921
对吗? 是的
Correct? - Yes.

17
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:54,455
那个软件
The software--

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,258
她知道其中一个人质是间谍
Did she know that one of the hostages was a spy

19
00:00:57,293 --> 00:01:00,395
而使得其他三个学生的生命受到了威胁吗?
endangering the other three students?

20
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:01,863
Um...

21
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,598
或许当时不是很清楚
possibly not quite at the time.

22
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:05,866
那么她那些说她自己在这次军事解救行动中
So all this stuff she's been saying about

23
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:08,703
扮演了重要角色的话都是谎言咯
being a crucial part of the military rescue is a lie.

24
00:01:08,737 --> 00:01:11,138
好吧 慢一点 Leon 你的血糖太低了吗?
Okay, slow down, Leon. Is your blood sugar off?

25
00:01:11,173 --> 00:01:13,974
不如来点点心或者鲱鱼 怎么样?
Have a pastry or some herring, okay?

26
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:16,210
请回答问题 我不知道她知道什么
- Answer the question. - I don't know what she knew

27
00:01:16,244 --> 00:01:18,245
或者她是何时知道的 Leon Mike Mike
- or when she knew it, Leon. - Mike, Mike.

28
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:21,715
要么她知道那个学生是个间谍
Either she knew that the student was a spy

29
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,216
然后在否认这件事的时候撒了谎
and lied when she denied it,

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,518
要么她不知道他是间谍
or she didn't know that he was a spy,

31
00:01:25,552 --> 00:01:28,688
但是谎称自己知道这次军事解救行动的细节
but lied about knowing the details of the military rescue.

32
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:30,757
这不是又一次说谎者Meyer 事件
This isn't Meyer the Liar again.

33
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,125
哦 现在是了
Well, it is now.

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,993
这不是个容易事儿 Selina
This isn't going to be a cakewalk, Selina.

35
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,728
哦 这是艰难的协议谈判

36
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,362
你不担心吗 我知道如何讨价还价
Don't you worry. I know how to haggle.

37
00:01:37,396 --> 00:01:38,931
当然
You betcha.

38
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,433
你儿子还好吗 他们很不错

39
00:01:41,467 --> 00:01:43,668
Catherine呢 她21了

44
00:01:53,212 --> 00:01:55,113
那是肯定的 而且远离中东政治
And stay out of Middle East politics.

45
00:01:55,147 --> 00:01:58,515
所以以上三点中有两个不那么糟糕
So two out of three ain't bad.

46
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,085
我很惊讶你居然能拿那个开玩笑
I'm amazed you can laugh about that.

47
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:04,222
是的 那就是我做的事 我在自嘲
Yes, that's what I do. I'm laughing about it.

48
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:06,157
她的那个男朋友...
She has that boyfriend.

49
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:08,558
你觉得他么会结婚吗? 我们是不是该继续…
- You think that's going to actually lead to a marriage? - Should we get going...

50
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:10,393
手边的事情? 没错 没错
- with this business at hand? - <i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.</i>

51
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:12,195
我很好奇里面进行得怎么样了
I wonder how it's going in there.

52
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,631
这就像等待活组织检查的结果
It's like waiting for a biopsy result.

53
00:02:14,665 --> 00:02:16,499
Mary是个狠角色
Mary's a player.

54
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,702
她曾经假装昏倒而在和Brian Earl的谈判中占了上风
She did own Brian Earl in negotiations by pretending to faint.

55
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:22,038

00:02:40,656 --> 00:02:42,924
你发过誓只会和特区外的人约会
You swore you were only gonna date outside DC.

66
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:44,893
他不在特区 他在波士顿工作
He's not in DC. He works in Boston.

67
00:02:44,927 --> 00:02:47,328
好吧 我妈也不住在罗马 但她仍然是个他妈的天主教徒
Well, my mom doesn't live in Rome, but she's still a fucking Catholic.

68
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:50,731
你被刺激了 Danny? 闭上你的臭嘴 Gary
- Are you getting worked up, Danny? - Shut the fuck up, Gary.

69
00:02:50,766 --> 00:02:51,833
我正开心你为我高兴 Dan

73
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:01,108
这儿唯一的真正削减是失业保险
The only real cut here is unemployment insurance.

74
00:03:01,142 --> 00:03:03,811
Mary 你知道总统不会削减
Mary, POTUS is not gonna make any cuts

75
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:06,046
任何失业保险的
to unemployment insurance and you know that.

76
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,115
需要我向你解释讨价还价是如何运作的吗
Do I need to explain to you how haggling works?

77
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:10,317
那全国卫生研究所削减10% 如何?
How about a 10% cut to NIH, okay?

78
00:03:10,351 --> 00:03:12,251
我要20% 那个数字我没法做到
- I need 20. - I can't do those numbers.

79
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,485
那行不通
That's not gonna work.

80
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,521
上帝保佑你 谢谢
- God bless you. - <i>Thank you.</i>

81
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:19,058
那么唯一的简单解决方案就是失业保险
Then the only obvious solution is unemployment insurance.

00:03:19,092 --> 00:03:22,829
不 我告诉过你了 我做不到

87
00:03:33,605 --> 00:03:35,740
我想这结束了 喷嚏总是不超过三个

你有注意过那个吗? 真的 是那样吗?

131
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:18,037
呃 就因为我的姓和说谎者押韵
Ugh, just because my last name rhymes with liar.

132
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:21,705
多亏我不是Selina Mapist (音近强奸犯)
How lucky am I that I'm not Selina Mapist

133

音爆小子前来报到 女士
Sonic boom in the room. Ma'am.

142
00:05:44,362 --> 00:05:46,029
不 哦 好吧
- No. - Oh, okay.

143
00:05:46,064 --> 00:05:47,465
好吧 总统要我来这
Well, POTUS wanted me to come down here

144
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,259
打探一下债务谈判的内部消息
and peep the skinny on the debt negotiations.

145
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,268
好吧 这个是火灾隐患 那么让我们就...
Okay, that's a fire hazard, so let's just...

146
00:05:51,302 --> 00:05:53,636
Gary 我是被总统派下来的...
Gary, I have been sent here from the president.

147
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:57,640
好吧 那个 总统已经承受了很多
Okay, so the president's already going through a lot of pressure

148
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:00,510
那个人质谎言破事的压力了
about this hostage lying bullshit.

149
00:06:00,544 --> 00:06:02,244
他饱受压力? 没错
- He's under pressure? - Yes.

150
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,714
我才饱受压力 好吧 你是有选择的
- I'm under pressure. - Well, you do have a choice.

151
00:06:04,748 --> 00:06:07,049
你可以说人质解救事件中你没有被告知所有事情
You could say you were out of the loop for the hostage rescue,

152
00:06:07,084 --> 00:06:09,852
这可以让你看起来无能 或者你可以选择说你确实知道
which would make you look clueless, or you could say you were in the loop,

153
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:11,687
而那会让你被认作不正直
which would make you look devious.

154
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,389
随便哪个 只要他妈的把它糊弄过去就行
Either way, just blur the fuck out of it.

155
00:06:14,423 --> 00:06:16,625
Uh-huh.

版本二 Mary King偷走了和睦烟斗 (北美印第安人用来表示和睦)
Version two-- Mary King steals peace pipe,

168
00:06:45,019 --> 00:06:46,920
一分为二 把它弄得一团糟
breaks it in half, shits all over it.

169
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:48,788
女士 你前夫刚打电话过来
Ma'am, your ex-husband just called.

170
00:06:48,823 --> 00:06:50,323
他说他想去接Catherine
He says that he wants to pick up Catherine.

171
00:06:50,357 --> 00:06:53,760
不 我已经派了车接她 我安排好了
No, I have a car picking her up already. I arranged that.

172
00:06:53,794 --> 00:06:57,129
他就是那样任性又贪婪的蠢货
He is such a conniving, grabby prick.

173
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:58,564
太典型了 对吧? 难以置信
- Is it typical or what? <i>- Unbelievable.</i>

174
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:01,266
就是不对 我太讨厌他了
Just wrong. - I hate him so much.

175
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,435
抱歉 我能问原因吗?
Sorry, can I ask why?

176
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:05,370
这个可以很好的解释
<i>This'll explain it perfectly.</i>

177
00:07:05,405 --> 00:07:08,007
几年前的情人节
Valentine's Day a couple years ago,

178
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,509
他送了我辆黑色的保时捷... 哦

用Catherine信任基金的钱买的

给你 然后
Here you go. So, he took me

184
00:07:22,153 --> 00:07:24,788
那晚他带我去了Cap d'Antibes (法国南部海滨小镇)
to Cap d'Antibes for the night.

185
00:07:24,822 --> 00:07:28,058
哦 他们有了一场疯狂的性交
Yeah, they had crazy intercourse.

186
00:07:29,594 --> 00:07:31,562
可就在那之后他告诉我
Only after which he told me

187
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:34,097
他卖掉了我们第二套房子
that he sold our second home.

188
00:07:34,131 --> 00:07:37,034
是的 是的 他就像个拿着锤子的肚皮舞者
Yeah, yeah. He's like a belly dancer with a hammer.

00:07:38,468 --> 00:07:41,103
你知道吗?我一点也不担心Andy
You know what? I'm not worried about Andy

191
00:07:41,137 --> 00:07:44,040
因为我要完全忘记他
because I'm gonna completely obliterate him

192
00:07:44,074 --> 00:07:47,009
用我他妈的姿态还有成熟
with my fucking poise and sophistication.

193
00:07:47,044 --> 00:07:48,911
知道我在说什么吗?
You know what I mean?

她在叫他Andy而不是Andrew
She's calling him Andy instead of Andrew.

196
00:07:52,883 --> 00:07:54,816
已经开始了 什么?

197
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,918
每次Andy到场
Every time Andy's on the scene,

198
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:58,620

但每次她在他周围的时候...

And you know what? That's a very fucking tough look to pull off.

422
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,093
哦 没错 棒极了
<i>Okay, yeah, great.</i>

423
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:35,961
是的 我们达成一致了 没错!
- Yeah, we have a deal. - Yeah!

424
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:38,730
这条件真快杀了我了 但我们达成一致了 完成了
- It nearly killed me, but we have a deal. - Put 'er there.

425
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,432
完成了 恭喜
- Put 'er there. - Congratulations.

426
00:17:40,466 --> 00:17:41,866
我无法相信 这不是...
- I can't believe it. - Isn't that--

427
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,540
我无法相信 Mary 这棒极了
I can't believe it, Mary. That's so great.

428
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,803
很好 现在我得说服我的党团了
It's good. Now I have to sell it to my caucus

429
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,039
在我变回南瓜之前 你会成功的
- before I turn into a pumpkin. - You'll do it.

430
00:17:48,073 --> 00:17:50,708
没错 哦 上帝
Yeah. Oh, God.

431
00:17:54,146 --> 00:17:56,780
天哪 21岁的人走得真快
Jesus, 21-year-olds move fast.

432
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:59,016
是啊 我早知道了
Yeah, tell me about it.

433
00:18:00,318 --> 00:18:01,918
您看起来不错 女士
You look good, ma'am.

434
00:18:01,953 --> 00:18:04,221
哦 谢谢 Jonah 你真的看起来很棒
- Oh, thanks, Jonah. - You look really good.

435
00:18:04,256 --> 00:18:06,923
谢谢 是的 女士
- Thank you. - Yes, ma'am.

436
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:14,297
你们看过这个了吗
Have you guys seen this?

437
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:17,066
切蛋糕和宾客们唱生日快乐歌的时候
When the cake was cut and the guests sang 'Happy Birthday, '

438
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,101
副总统无处可寻
the VP was nowhere to be seen.

439
00:18:19,136 --> 00:18:20,970
他们说我和Andrew吵翻了
They're saying I had some sort of huge fight

440
00:18:21,004 --> 00:18:24,240
我们的关系是场骗局
with Andrew and that our relationship is a sham.

441
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:27,008
这帮禽兽! 先是戴安娜王妃 现在是这个
Monsters. It's like first Princess Diana, now this.

442
00:18:27,043 --> 00:18:28,410
他们认为一开始
They think that at the beginning of the night

443
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:31,180
你和Andrew是对着镜头做戏
you and Andrew were playing it up to the cameras.

444
00:18:31,214 --> 00:18:34,115
他们再次玩起了说谎者Meyer的烂梗
And they're using this Meyer the Liar bullshit again.

445
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,950
嘿 Mike 谁把那个挖出来的?
Hey, Mike, who dug that up?

446
00:18:35,985 --> 00:18:38,720
不知道 也许是某些记住它的蠢货
I don't know. Probably just some idiot remembered it

447
00:18:38,754 --> 00:18:40,255
然后突然被大肆追捧
and then all of a sudden it got traction.

448
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:41,557
现在是来自《赫芬顿邮报》
And this is from HuffPo.

449
00:18:41,591 --> 00:18:43,457
Randall Howard即将出版的书宣称
Randall Howard's forthcoming book

450
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:46,173
您和Andrew在总统选战时的关系
claims your relationship with Andrew during the presidential campaign

451
00:18:46,195 --> 00:18:49,197
是你说的用来迷惑选民的谎言
was a lie invented by you to mislead voters.

452
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,765
那是个谎言 对吧?
That's a lie, right?

453
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,633
没错 那是事实并且确实发生了 但那是Kent撒的谎
- Yeah. - I mean, it's true

454
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,136
and it's what happened, but it's Kent's lie.

455
00:18:55,171 --> 00:18:56,270
不是我 没错
- It's not my lie. - Right.

456
00:18:56,305 --> 00:18:58,806
说谎者Meyer现在可是大热点
Meyer the Liar has huge mo right now.

457
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,309
你知道的 就像人们说的 如果押韵 就会共鸣
You know, as people say, if it rhymes, it chimes.

458
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:04,544
谁说的?没人那么说
Who says that? No one says that.

459
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,680
我很确定有听人说过
I'm pretty sure I heard someone say that.

460
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:08,355
哦 现在变成叙述语气了...
Well, it's becoming a narrative right now.

461
00:19:08,382 --> 00:19:11,752
说的是你以前假装了
And the narrative is that you faked it before,

462
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,187
现在肯定也是装出来的
so you must be faking it now.

463
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,954
哦 棒极了 Eeyore驴来了 (小熊维尼里的忧郁驴)
Oh, great. Here's Eeyore.

464
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,923
协议 砰 派对 砰
Deal, boom. Party, boom.

465
00:19:16,957 --> 00:19:18,791
你就是砰砰副总统
You are the boom boom veep.

466
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:22,461
哦 Catherine很反感昨晚在派对上谈财政的不速之客
Well, Catherine didn't appreciate the fiscal party crashers last night.

467
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,197
今晚Andy和我得带她去吃晚饭
Andy and I have to take her out to dinner tonight

468
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:26,332
来弥补昨天的派对 所以...
to make up for the party last night, so...

469
00:19:26,366 --> 00:19:27,934
好吧 那会面向公众
Okay, it'll be in public.

470
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:30,302
所以不管你在做什么 别看起来像在弄虚作假
So whatever you do, don't look like you're faking it

471
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:34,072
因为说谎者Meyer已经变成了他娘的大雪崩了
because this Meyer the Liar thing is just an avalanche of shit right now.

472
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:36,141
是的 还用你说 我现在就在雪崩里畅游
Yeah, tell me about it. And I'm swimming in it

473
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,909
还是通过呼吸管呼吸的
and I'm breathing it in through my snorkel.

474
00:19:37,944 --> 00:19:39,945
你得发表一份声明 好吗?
You need to issue a statement, okay?

475
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:42,214
我的私生活是隐私 是的
my private life is private. - Yes.

476
00:19:42,248 --> 00:19:44,682
还有 Andrew和我 我们相处得还好
Besides, Andrew and I, we get along just fine.

477
00:19:44,717 --> 00:19:46,251
讽刺的是 Ben
Ironically, Ben,

478
00:19:46,285 --> 00:19:48,786
我们事实上相处得是还不错
we actually are getting along just fine.

479
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,421
这很好 装得很像
That's great. That's a great fake.

480
00:19:51,456 --> 00:19:53,624
不 这不是装的 这是真的
No, it's not a fake. That's a real thing.

481
00:19:53,658 --> 00:19:56,961
哦 好吧 棒极了 就那么说
Oh. Well, great. Say that.

482
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,963
我很抱歉
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

483
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,464
昨晚的派对
<i>That party last night</i>

484
00:20:00,498 --> 00:20:02,399
变成了一个经济峰会
turned into an economic summit.

485
00:20:02,433 --> 00:20:04,768
但是你知道吗? 我们今晚为了你而相聚
But you know what? Here we are now for you.

486
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:06,669
生日快乐 还有你
- Happy birthday. - And to you,

487
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:09,438
和鲨鱼同游的男人
a man who swims with sharks.

488
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:11,407
还开始自由潜水了 真的吗?那是什么?
Also starting free diving. - Really? What is that?

489
00:20:11,441 --> 00:20:14,710
是不是那种尽力憋气憋到底的?
Is that when you try and hold your breath for as long as possible?

490
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:17,413
就像感恩节晚餐后坐在我妈旁边那样
Kind of like sitting next to my mother after Thanksgiving dinner.

491
00:20:19,582 --> 00:20:21,216
妈妈 你又开始假笑了
Mom, you're doing your fake laugh again.

492
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,485
什么? 嘿 这很好
- What? - Come on, this is nice.

493
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:25,154
我都看不出来是假笑
I can't tell if it's fake.

494
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,256
你从来都不知道我是不是装的 (三俗双关)
You could never tell if it was fake.

495
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,356
不 我能
Yes, I could.

496
00:20:28,391 --> 00:20:31,226
唔嗯 你是什么 某种专家?
Mm-hmm. What are you, some sort of expert?

497
00:20:31,261 --> 00:20:33,295
在某些领域吧
In certain areas.

498
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:35,663
现在这是干什么? 这是调情
- What is going on right now? <i>- This is flirting.</i>

499
00:20:35,697 --> 00:20:38,132
你妈妈是个出色的调情者
Your mother is an excellent flirt.

500
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:39,600
你得做些调情笔记
You should take flirting notes.

501
00:20:39,634 --> 00:20:41,102
这不是调情
This is not flirting.

502
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:44,471
这就和在facebook上放裸照一样直白
This is like as subtle as putting a nude photo on Facebook.

503
00:20:44,506 --> 00:20:47,374
Selina会注意到这个隐形人吗?
Do you think Selina would notice the invisible man

504
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:50,244
来自波士顿政治行动委员会办公室的
from the Boston PAC office if I showed up at the office

505
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:51,845
你觉得如果我穿上政治行动委员会制服的话
in a Pac-Man costume?

506
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:54,314
我知道 抱歉
I know, I'm sorry.

507
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:56,283
抱歉 不过你为什么要抱歉?
<i>I'm sorry,</i> <i>why are you sorry?</i>

508
00:20:56,317 --> 00:20:57,818
我不知道
I don't know.

509
00:20:57,852 --> 00:21:00,921
我听到牢骚所以我以为我需要道歉
I heard whining and I assumed I needed to apologize.

510
00:21:00,955 --> 00:21:04,024
你有多长时间没有听我说话了?
How long have you not been listening to me?

511
00:21:04,058 --> 00:21:06,726
我只是很需要密切关注这个
I just really need to watch this because Andrew

512
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,294
因为Andrew就像一座休眠火山
is like a dormant volcano

513
00:21:08,328 --> 00:21:10,729
可能随时爆发
and he can just blow at any second.

514
00:21:10,763 --> 00:21:12,932
我想我要吃些扇贝
I think I'm gonna have the scallops.

515
00:21:12,966 --> 00:21:14,834
我想我要吃 我知道你想要吃什么
- I think I'm gonna have-- - I know what you're gonna have.

516
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:17,937
你要吃... 别那么做
- You are going to have-- - Don't do that.

517
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:19,438
唔? 把你的手放下来
Hmm? - Put your hand down.

518
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:23,708
我没法忍受这种男人至上式的傲慢
I can't stand that alpha male arrogant thing.

519
00:21:23,742 --> 00:21:25,109
我真的没法忍受 Andrew
I really can't stand it, Andrew.

520
00:21:25,144 --> 00:21:27,111
好吧 那不是傲慢
<i>Okay, it's not arrogant.</i>

521
00:21:27,146 --> 00:21:29,280
去你妈的你那么想
And fuck you for thinking so.

522
00:21:29,315 --> 00:21:32,283
原谅我 我只是在预测你的点餐
Forgive me, I was just anticipating your order.

523
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:34,919
是什么? 羊排
Which was? - Lamb cutlets.

524
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:36,520
不是
No.

525
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:38,122
是的 我很抱歉我了解你 Selina
Yeah. I'm sorry I know you, Selina.

526
00:21:38,157 --> 00:21:40,057
原谅我 你对我而言不是个大谜题
Forgive me. You're not a big mystery to me.

527
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:43,126
而我非常享受这种像打了石膏的僵硬笑容
And I'm very much enjoying the plastered-on smile,

528
00:21:43,161 --> 00:21:45,628
假装一切都很好 因为人们在看着
pretending everything's okay because people are watching.

529
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:47,630
别这么混蛋 Andrew
Don't be a bastard, Andrew.

530
00:21:47,665 --> 00:21:50,200
你得做出同样的脸
You've got to do the same face.

531
00:21:50,235 --> 00:21:52,602
你也得这么笑 就是这样
You put it on, too. There we go.

532
00:21:52,636 --> 00:21:55,839
好吧 哦 现在这种调情算是比较隐晦了
Okay, well, now this flirting is a little bit more subtle.

533
00:21:55,873 --> 00:21:58,007
那么 Ed Eddie
So, Ed. Eddie.

534
00:21:58,041 --> 00:22:00,076
你认识谁?你知道Ray McCaskill吗?
Who do you know? Do you know Ray McCaskill?

535
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,178
是的 他是很好的人
Yeah, he's a great guy.

536
00:22:02,212 --> 00:22:04,447
我们都很喜欢80年代的友情戏剧
We both are really into '80s buddy comedies,

537
00:22:04,482 --> 00:22:06,516
很讽刺的是这就是我们变成朋友的方式
which is ironically how we became buddies.

538
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:08,050
炮友吧
Fuck buddies.

539
00:22:08,085 --> 00:22:09,753
Jonah 你为什么在这
Jonah, why are you here?

540
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,053
你真的没有任何事可以做 是吗?
You really don't have anything to do, do you?

541
00:22:12,088 --> 00:22:15,323
瞧 别理他 别理谁?
- Look, ignore him. - Ignore who?

542
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,128
嘿 我觉得这里的那位女士刚刚拍了Selina
Hey, I think that lady right there just took a photo of Selina.

543
00:22:20,162 --> 00:22:21,463
这个?
This one?

544
00:22:21,498 --> 00:22:24,232
我明白你们之间是爱恨交织
I understand that you guys have a love-hate relationship,

545
00:22:24,267 --> 00:22:26,301
但很多人的这些感情都会轮着来
but most people alternate emotions.

546
00:22:26,335 --> 00:22:28,536
他们不会同时展露爱恨两种情绪
They don't experience them at the same time.

547
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,237
我们一直保持着反复无常的关系
We've always had a volatile relationship.

548
00:22:30,272 --> 00:22:32,139
你这么说指的是疯到掉渣吧
By that you mean bat shit crazy.

549
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,942
激情总是当中不可缺少的部分 没错
- Passion was always an integral part. <i>- Yeah.</i>

550
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:37,044
是的 还有争吵 漫长而辛苦的争吵
Yes, there was fights. Long, hard fights.

551
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:40,948
之后是漫长而辛苦的...
Followed by long, hard...

552
00:22:40,982 --> 00:22:42,349
和好 对吧?
making up, right?

553
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:45,184
好吧 我觉得你们马上就要
Okay, I feel like you're actually going to have sex

554
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:48,154
在这张桌上开干了  而那真的会毁掉我的生日
on this table and that would truly ruin my birthday.

555
00:22:48,188 --> 00:22:51,825
Catherine 算了吧 没人会在桌子上开干的
Catherine, please. Nobody's having sex on the table.

556
00:22:53,394 --> 00:22:56,763
我是说 我们是性爱的动物 当然 哦 天哪
- I mean, we are sexual beings, of course. - Oh, my God.

557
00:22:56,798 --> 00:22:58,298
我们有过性爱 我们 你知道
We had sex. We, you know--

558
00:22:58,332 --> 00:23:01,634
我是说 很棒的性爱 很棒...的性爱
- I mean, great sex. - Great sex.

559
00:23:01,668 --> 00:23:04,670
好吧 我得给我的心理医生发短信了
Well, I'm going to have to text my therapist.

560
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,705
那个不能喝酒是怎么回事?
What's the whole not drinking thing?

561
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,507
我是个贵格教徒 什么?
- I'm a Quaker. - What?

562
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:11,209
扯淡! 没人是他妈的贵格教徒
Bullshit. No one's a fucking Quaker.

563
00:23:11,244 --> 00:23:13,546
你大概认为保持冷静会让你保持状态
You probably think that staying sober keeps you on top of your game.

564
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,614
哦 猜 我努力工作也努力玩 贱人
Well, guess what. I work hard and I play hard, bitch.

565
00:23:16,649 --> 00:23:18,015
这是我的信条
That's my credo.

566
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,352
我把该死的那个纹在了我的JJ上 还有空余的地方
I got that shit tattooed on my dick with room to spare.

567
00:23:21,386 --> 00:23:23,387
Jonah 你甚至都还不是人
Jonah, you're not even a man.

568
00:23:23,422 --> 00:23:25,690
你只能算是人的草稿
You're like an early draft of a man

569
00:23:25,724 --> 00:23:28,827
那草稿上只随便画了一个巨大的骨架
where they just sketched out a giant mangled skeleton,

570
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,528
可他们没有时间去添加细节
but they didn't have time to add details

571
00:23:30,563 --> 00:23:31,962
比方说上色啦自尊啦之类的东西
like pigment or self-respect.

572
00:23:31,996 --> 00:23:34,297
如果科学怪人是用死人的老二拼起来的话 (参见同名科幻小说及电影)
<i>You're Frankenstein's monster</i>

573
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:37,568
你就是那个怪物
if his monster was made entirely of dead dicks.

574
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,437
我去洗手间
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

575
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:43,006
别在我离开的时候让你们自己难堪
Just try not to embarrass yourselves while I'm gone.

576
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,608
我们会尽量试试
We'll give it a shot.

577
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:47,110
很高兴见到你
Nice to see you.

578
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,044
唔 抱歉
Um, I'm sorry.

579
00:23:49,079 --> 00:23:50,947
我能打扰一会吗 唔 不行
- Can I interrupt a second? - Uh, no.

580
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,683
看起来这有很多人正在发推特
It just looks like there's a lot of people who are tweeting

581
00:23:53,717 --> 00:23:56,752
还有照相 所以你们大概希望能注意下姿势
and taking pictures, so you might want to be gesture-aware.

582
00:23:56,787 --> 00:23:58,988
还好 谢谢 你可以离开了
It's fine. Thank you. You can go.

583
00:24:02,893 --> 00:24:04,926
好的? 是的 好吧
- Okay? - Yeah, okay.

584
00:24:06,829 --> 00:24:08,597
我想告诉你点事
I want to tell you something.

585
00:24:08,631 --> 00:24:10,966
什么?
What?

586
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,568
唔 公关负责人告诉我
Um, the head of PR

587
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:16,204
说在上次选举的时候我们公司同时资助了
told me that our company funded super PACs

588
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:18,940
两边的超级政治行动委员会
on both sides during the last election.

589
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:21,842
我先被捧上了天
I just was fluffed

590
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,144
然后被狠狠地摔到了地上
and then I got fucked.

591
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:28,148
我无法相信你刚刚告诉我的事情
I cannot believe what you are telling me.

592
00:24:28,182 --> 00:24:30,350
你知道...微笑
Do you know-- smile.

593
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,921
微笑 你这愚蠢的混蛋 笑开一点
Smile, you stupid asshole. Make it bigger.

594
00:24:33,955 --> 00:24:35,822
就是这样
There you go.

595
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:39,225
你知道媒体现在是怎么众口一词说我的么?
Do you have any idea how the press is all over me right now?

596
00:24:39,259 --> 00:24:42,328
他们会怎么样报道
And how they are gonna run with the story

597
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:44,864
我资助我对手的故事?
about me funding my opponent?

598
00:24:44,899 --> 00:24:47,767
你就是个他妈的蠢货
You're a stupid fucking prick.

599
00:24:47,801 --> 00:24:49,769
对吗? 你说
Right? You say it.

600
00:24:49,803 --> 00:24:51,270
我不会那么说
I'm not gonna say that.

601
00:24:51,304 --> 00:24:53,471
好吧 现在发生了什么?
Okay, what happened now?

602
00:24:53,506 --> 00:24:56,642
你们看起来就像要用牛排刀捅对方
You guys look like you're going to stab each other with steak knives.

603
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:59,411
我们正在吵架 我们也在微笑
We're having a fight and we are smiling

604
00:24:59,445 --> 00:25:02,548
然后摆出虚假的表情 你也能做到 就是这样
and putting a face on and you can do that, too. There you go.

605
00:25:02,582 --> 00:25:04,482
Selina 这只是生意
Selina, this is just business.

606
00:25:04,517 --> 00:25:06,585
我们希望最终能和胜利者一起
We want to end up with the winner at the end.

607
00:25:06,619 --> 00:25:09,219
没有任何私人恩怨在里面 我保证
There's nothing personal about it, I promise.

608
00:25:09,254 --> 00:25:10,588
我甚至不知道这件事
I didn't even know about it.

609
00:25:10,622 --> 00:25:12,924
哦 扯你妈的淡
Oh, that's utter bullshit.

610
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,392
但你知道吗?我会搞定它
But you know what? I'm keeping it together.

611
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:17,828
我确实会 这些都很好
I really am. It's all good.

612
00:25:17,863 --> 00:25:20,197
我们能保持微笑 保持微笑 没错
We Can Keep smiling. - Keep smiling. Yeah.

613
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:22,033
我想如果你们继续微笑
I think that if you guys continue to smile,

614
00:25:22,067 --> 00:25:24,301
你们会得永久性的牙关紧闭症
you're actually gonna get permanent lockjaw.

615
00:25:24,335 --> 00:25:26,070
她真有趣
She's so funny.

616
00:25:26,104 --> 00:25:28,505
不是吗? 真讽刺
- Isn't she? - Sarcastic.

617
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,874
我很抱歉打扰你们 我刚接到Kent的电话
I'm sorry to interrupt. I just had a call from Kent.

618
00:25:30,908 --> 00:25:34,445
哦 来恭喜我 因为我促成了昨晚的协议
Oh, to congratulate me 'cause I made the deal last night.

619
00:25:34,479 --> 00:25:36,113
美国感谢你 不客气
- America thanks you. - You're welcome.

620
00:25:36,147 --> 00:25:38,048
总统会暂缓那个协议
POTUS is going to stall on that deal.

621
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:40,616
不 不 不 他为什么要那么做? 那不对
No, no, no. Why would he want to do that? That can't be right.

622
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:42,785
哦 在我看来那听起来像是他想政府停工
Well, it sounds to me like he wants a government shutdown

623
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:45,588
所以他可以责怪国会并让间谍的事情降温
so he can blame it on Congress and take the heat out of the spy story.

624
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,756
你听到了吗 是的
did You hear that? - Yeah.

625
00:25:47,791 --> 00:25:50,259
去他妈的的总统 对吗?  还有去他妈的Kent
Fuck POTUS. Right? And fuck Kent.

626
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:51,994
他们就是一群混蛋
They're just a bunch of fuckers.

627
00:25:52,028 --> 00:25:53,362
喔 哦 不 不 不
- Uh-oh. - No, no, no.

628
00:25:53,397 --> 00:25:55,298
他们刚刚拍到了?我发火的样子?
Did they just get that? Me being angry?

629
00:25:55,332 --> 00:25:57,932
哦 是的 但我不是对你发火
- Oh, yeah. - But I wasn't being angry with you.

630
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:00,034
我是说 我之前有对你发火
I mean, I was angry with you before,

631
00:26:00,069 --> 00:26:02,036
但不是现在
but I'm not angry with you now.

632
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:05,440
我知道那个 亲爱的 首先别叫我亲爱的
- I understand that, honey. - Don't call me honey for starters.

633
00:26:05,475 --> 00:26:07,142
你得冷静下来 你看起来快疯了
You have to calm down. You look crazed.

634
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:09,377
我们能没收那只电话吗? 我希望我们可以
- Can we confiscate that phone, please? - I wish we could.

635
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:11,079
我想太迟了 抱歉
- I think it's too late. - Excuse me.

636
00:26:11,114 --> 00:26:13,981
推特上有张照片显示你们在吵架
There's a picture on Twitter and it looks like you guys are fighting.

637
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:16,683
什么? 就那个? 是的
What? From that? - Yes.

638
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:19,786
看这个 瞧 这不是事实
Look at this. Look. This is not what it is.

639
00:26:19,821 --> 00:26:22,156
我指向你是因为我被总统弄疯了
I'm pointing to you because I'm mad about POTUS.

640
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:24,225
我没有说我因为你而对你发火
I wasn't saying that I was angry to you about you.

641
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:25,759
好吧 你让事情更糟糕了
Okay, Lee, you're just making it worse.

642
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,428
我没有 是他们
I'm not making it worse. They're making it worse.

643
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,596
爸爸 别那么做 你能不能别这么做了?
- <i>Dad, don't do that thing.</i> - Would you just cut that out?

644
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,564
每个人都来唱
<i>Everybody sing.</i>

645
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,501
不 不 不 我们得走了
Nope, nope, nope. We have to go.

646
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:37,337
好吧 好吧 吹灭你的蜡烛 亲爱的
- Okay. Okay. - Blow out your candles, honey.

647
00:26:37,371 --> 00:26:39,472
有什么意义? 好吧 我来吹
- What's the point? - Okay, I'll do it.

648
00:26:39,507 --> 00:26:40,873
许个愿 那里 灭了

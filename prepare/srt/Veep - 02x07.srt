God, that is really bad.

我们能把这堆破玩意弄走吗
Can't we get this shit out of here?

3
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:14,066
得等到停工结束
Not until the shutdown is over.

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:15,767
垃圾回收暂停服务了...

我是不是听到副总统尖叫了?
Did I hear the VP scream?

7
00:00:20,073 --> 00:00:23,542
不 那是我 而且那是在大喊
No, that was me. And it was a shout.

8
00:00:23,576 --> 00:00:25,478
垃圾堆里有只老鼠
There was a rat on the garbage,

9
00:00:25,512 --> 00:00:27,313
所以我大喊把它吓走
so I shouted to scare it off.

10
00:00:27,347 --> 00:00:30,784
那是男人的声音?  当然 因为我是个男人
- That was a man's voice? - Yeah, 'cause I'm a man.

11
00:00:30,818 --> 00:00:33,287
我有副男人的嗓子
I have a man's voice.

我向上帝发誓 那超大的
I swear to God, it was massive.

15
00:00:55,614 --> 00:00:57,249
就像匹小马  吱吱 吱吱
- It was like a pony. - Squeak, squeak.

16
00:00:57,283 --> 00:00:58,884
神啊 停! 这一点都不酷
God! Stop! That's not cool.

17
00:00:58,918 --> 00:01:01,587
好吧 伙计们 我就开门见山了
Okay, guys, I'm not gonna drag this out.

18
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:02,754
我们正处于停工阶段
We're in shutdown mode.

19
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,623
我得留下骨干员工
I've got to have a skeleton staff.

20
00:01:04,657 --> 00:01:06,492
那么Keith留下来 对吗  什么?
- So Keith stays, right? - What?

21
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:08,962
Keith 他瘦的只剩骨干了
Keith. He's skinny like a skeleton.

22
00:01:08,996 --> 00:01:10,864
女士 求你 我负担不起停职
Ma'am, please. I can't afford to be furloughed.

哦 你知道的 你们两个做类似的工作
Yeah, you know, you two do similar jobs.

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,171
从经济意义上来说你走更合适 Dan
It just makes economic sense for you to go, Dan.

26
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:18,706
那是说他挣的比我多?
Does that mean he makes more money than I do?

27
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:20,475
不管怎么说 这不会太久
Anyway, the deal is it's not going to be long

28
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,210
因为今天我会和议长会晤
because I've got a meeting with the Speaker today.

29
00:01:22,245 --> 00:01:23,679
对吧?  今天 是的
- Is that correct? - Today, yes.

30
00:01:23,713 --> 00:01:25,147
所以我会停止这次停工
So I'm gonna shut down the shutdown.

31
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,715
看起来会在你我之间做出选择
It looks like it's between you and me.

32
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,350
没有我 这办公室会崩溃
Without me, this office will implode.

可怜的Sue  我猜我得出去了
- Poor Sue. - I guess I'll be heading out.

126
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:04,009

抱歉 女士 我不是故意的
I'm sorry, ma'am. I didn't mean to do that.

Do you want to let me know some of the things that are in the bags?

你知道 内啡肽 (强效止痛)

我很高兴我们谈过了 达成了共识

185
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:48,007
因为我们有个压缩机

239
00:09:58,438 --> 00:10:01,974
潜台词是 女士... 你失败了

而且此次政府停工被归咎到了你头上

大量的负面消息
there's a lot of poison coming

Roger Furlong?

257

你说是就是吧 对我来说都一样

副总统女士 你被挤出了预算协议

283
00:11:46,813 --> 00:11:49,715
我要鸡肉沙拉和健怡可乐
I'm gonna go chicken salad and a Diet Coke.

284
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,085
胡说  给他来一份和我一样的
Nonsense. Give him exactly what I'm having.

285
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:53,652
我们会分享那瓶香槟
<i>And we will split the champagne.</i>

286
00:11:53,687 --> 00:11:55,654
这是我们第一次约会
It's our first date.

287
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:02,060
(我的丈夫就离守林人小站15码远的地方被杀害)
My husband was killed 15 yards from a ranger's station.

288
00:12:02,095 --> 00:12:04,696
这是最混乱的故事
This is the most fucked-up story.

289
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,798
我是说 被熊弄死了?
I mean, killed by a bear?

290
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:09,402
(因为停工 没有任何公园守林人值班)
No park rangers on site due to the shutdown.

291
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:10,503
而且还是只黑熊 这就是奇怪的地方 (黑熊体型较棕熊小 攻击性弱)
And a black bear. That's the weird part.

292
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,305
他们甚少袭击人类 这很奇怪
They rarely attack people. That's weird.

293
00:12:12,339 --> 00:12:14,975
没错 那是我... 他肯定刺激了它
Right. That's what I was... then he must have goaded him.

294
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,245
他肯定拿棍子打了它或者做了些蠢事
He must have hit him with a stick or done something stupid.

295
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,247
嘲弄它或者强迫那只熊跳舞
Taunting him or forcing the bear to dance.

296
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:22,583
熊不喜欢跳舞  你要来跳个舞吗?
<i>- Bears don't like to dance. - Would you dance, please?</i>

297
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,985
在娱乐行业中没有快乐的熊  或者他试图干那只熊
- There's not a happy bear in show business. - Or he tried to fuck the bear.

298
00:12:25,053 --> 00:12:27,856
他试图干...  就像Grizzly Adams (小说人物 驯熊人)
He tried to fuck... - Like Grizzly Adams.

299
00:12:27,923 --> 00:12:30,225
哦 呀  自娱自乐?
- Oh, jeez. - Enjoying yourselves?

300
00:12:30,259 --> 00:12:31,693
没错  你们在嘲笑
<i>- We were. - Are you laughing</i>

301
00:12:31,728 --> 00:12:33,528
那个年轻男人残酷的死亡?
at the violent death of a young man?

302
00:12:33,563 --> 00:12:37,366
没错 可以那么说  我以为你被暂时停职了 Kent
- Yeah, pretty much. - I thought you were on furlough, Kent.

303
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,167
我的降噪耳机忘在这了
Forgot my noise-cancelling headphones.

304
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,270
猜我刚刚听到了什么
Guess what I just heard.

305
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:43,672
我不在这 所以 我的耳朵也不在这
I'm not here. Ergo, my ears aren't here either.

306
00:12:43,706 --> 00:12:46,175
好吧 总统的采访中有段引言
Okay. POTUS's quote

307
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:48,978
在马上要出版的《政客》里
in his soon-to-be-released Politico interview

308
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:52,882
他将政府停工归咎于我
in which he blames me for the government shutdown.

309
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,316
什么?  没错 什么?
What? - Exactly. What?

310
00:12:54,351 --> 00:12:56,252
那很含蓄  含蓄?
<i>- It was implicit. - Implicit?</i>

311
00:12:56,319 --> 00:12:58,922
含蓄得像在我屁股上贴个踢我贴纸
Implicit like a kick me sticker

312
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:00,757
那种会含蓄?
on my keister would be implicit?

313
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:02,893
副总统女士 恕我直言
Madam Vice President, greatest respect,

314
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:05,462
但一直以来副总统的工作就是
but it has been the job of the VP over the ages

315
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:08,131
为拯救总统而贡献出屁股
to take it in the ass to save the president.

316
00:13:08,165 --> 00:13:09,432
没错  让我来告诉你
Yeah, let me tell you something.

317
00:13:09,466 --> 00:13:11,801
这个屁股已经停止营业了
This ass is closed for business.

318
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:14,636
这个屁股正紧闭 我不想当诱饵
This ass is in clench-down. I don't want to be a decoy.

319
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:17,272
让总统把屁股贡献出来吧 他会喜欢的
Let the president take it in the ass. He might like it.

320
00:13:17,307 --> 00:13:19,074
这些有权力的男人和女人们
These powerful men and women,

321
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:22,143
他们无法在任何事情上达成共识
they couldn't agree on anything.

322
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,878
你在玩我
You've got to be kidding me.

323
00:13:23,913 --> 00:13:25,747
现在我因为某个蠢货
Now I'm to blame because some goober

324
00:13:25,781 --> 00:13:27,482
被熊啃干净了而遭受指责?
got all eaten up by a bear?

325
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,350
你得把你的媒体人弄来搞定这个 懂吗?
You've got to get your press guys on this, okay?

326
00:13:29,385 --> 00:13:32,353
是的 女士  女士 是在明尼苏达州 好吗?
- Yes, ma'am. - Ma'am, this is in Minnesota, right?

327
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:34,522
Chung州长会揪住这件事不放
So Governor Chung is gonna be all over this

328
00:13:34,556 --> 00:13:36,191
就像盯住蠢货的熊  当然 没错
- like a bear on an idiot. - Of course. That's right.

329
00:13:36,225 --> 00:13:38,860
至少 采取什么行动
At the very least, let's get in front of something

330
00:13:38,894 --> 00:13:40,729
并且联系上这个寡妇
and get in touch with this widow.

331
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:42,865
是的 你听到了吗 Mike  呃 呃
- Yeah. Did you hear that, Mike? - Uh-uh.

332
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,500
熊寡妇 跟那个熊寡妇联络
The bear widow. Get in touch with the bear widow.

333
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:45,868
还有联络那些媒体人?
As well as get in touch with the press guys?

334
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:47,435
是的 还有那些媒体人
Yeah, as well as get in touch with the press guys.

335
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,537
两件事 打电话给《吉尼斯世界纪录》
Two things. Call the Guinness Book of World Records.

336
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:52,373
哦 不 不 别 别 因为那会是三件事
Oh, no, no, don't, don't, because that would be three things.

337
00:13:53,809 --> 00:13:55,809
那么你真不打算吃那个龙虾?
So you're really not gonna eat that lobster?

338
00:13:55,844 --> 00:13:56,844
哦 不 我讨厌龙虾
Oh, no, I hate lobster.

339
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,312
你知道的Dan 我们可以用你
You know, Dan, we could use you.

340
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,814
你觉得去内布拉斯加州
How do you feel about swindling

341
00:14:00,848 --> 00:14:03,583
忽悠一群当地二逼们怎么样?
a bunch of sister fuckers out of their land in Nebraska?

342
00:14:03,617 --> 00:14:06,219
我们想装 一条穿过他们地盘的输油管道
We're trying to skirt a pipeline through their backyard

343
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:07,888
而他们因为某些原因不同意
and they're not a fan for some reason.

344
00:14:07,922 --> 00:14:09,656
你想摆脱一些农场主 嗯?
You want to get rid of some farm folk, huh?

345
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:12,559
就把我当成你的整装黑风暴吧 我的朋友 (造成30年代美国农业巨大损失的公害事件)
Consider me your well-groomed dust bowl, my friend.

346
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:14,861
嘿 哦 天哪 你让它抽了一下
Hey, ooh! Boy, you made it twitch.

347
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,730
不过如果你真想让我的老二跳起舞来的话
But if you really want to make my dick dance,

348
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:19,066
你为什么不告诉我副总统办公室里发生了什么?
why don't you tell me what's going on in the VP's office?

349
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:24,105
好吧 你知道的 我不能说得太仔细
Well, you know, I can't really be too specific.

350
00:14:24,139 --> 00:14:25,606
当然 当然 不 我们可以...
Sure, sure. No, we can...

351
00:14:25,641 --> 00:14:27,609
我们为什么不用一些代码呢?
why don't we come up with some kind of code?

352
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:30,679
这里 副总统是龙虾
Here, the VP will be the lobster.

353
00:14:30,713 --> 00:14:33,215
Amy 绿色蔬菜 我们叫Mike胡萝卜
Amy, greens. We'll call Mike carrots.

354
00:14:33,249 --> 00:14:34,549
Dan 你可以是虾
Dan, you can be shrimp.

355
00:14:34,584 --> 00:14:36,818
你看到我做了什么吗 Dan? 我把你变成了虾
Do you see what I did there, Dan? I made you shrimp.

356
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:39,955
天 我真希望我点了一盘无用的混蛋
Boy, I just wish I ordered a plate of useless assholes.

357
00:14:39,989 --> 00:14:43,058
但你手里有什么兵就只能用什么兵了  对吗? (前国防部长Rumsfeld名言)
But you go to war with the army you have, right?

358
00:14:43,093 --> 00:14:44,927
好吧 我想这只龙虾
Okay, I think the lobster

359
00:14:44,961 --> 00:14:46,896
和她的前夫又走到一起了
is getting back together with her ex-husband.

360
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:50,499
绿色蔬菜几乎没法控制局面
The greens are only barely keeping it together.

361
00:14:50,534 --> 00:14:54,937
Mike... 胡萝卜债务缠身
Mike... the carrots are drowning in debt.

362
00:14:54,972 --> 00:14:58,908
而这只小虾想听听更多关于内布拉斯加交易的事情
And this little shrimp wants to hear more about this Nebraska deal.

363
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:00,811
想去大玉米带对吧? (美国中部的大农业带)
Want to go to the corn belt, do you?

364
00:15:00,845 --> 00:15:02,646
我想出击 我想为你一击必杀
I want to hit it. I want to hit it hard for you.

365
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,848
哦 敲敲你的红宝石鞋跟然后赶紧
Well, tap your ruby slippers together

366
00:15:04,883 --> 00:15:07,384
他妈醒醒吧 没有工作 Dorothy  (见《绿野仙踪》)
and wake the fuck up. There is no job, Dorothy.

367
00:15:07,418 --> 00:15:09,653
但我很惊讶你可以出卖
But I'm very impressed that you would turn on

368
00:15:09,687 --> 00:15:12,389
你在副总统办公室的所有伙伴
all of your compadres there in the vice president's office.

369
00:15:12,424 --> 00:15:15,792
那么你为什么不带着你的 甜蜜惊悚小舞蹈去找Danny Chung呢?
So why don't you take your little vanilla Thriller dance over to Danny Chung?

370
00:15:15,827 --> 00:15:19,529
他是目前肮脏政坛里炙手可热的无耻新星
He's the shiny turd rising to the top of the bowl right now.

371
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:21,464
你就喜欢无耻之徒 不是吗 Dan?
You like turds, don't you, Dan?

372
00:15:21,499 --> 00:15:24,434
是的 不 不 不 不
Yeah. No, no, no, no.

373
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:27,036
那不是我真正的意思 你误解了 说实在的
That's really not what I meant. You misunderstood, honestly.

374
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:30,840
当我说失误 我是说那不是你丈夫的失误
When I said fault, I meant that it wasn't your husband's fault

375
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:34,343
因为熊天生就会饿
because bears are naturally hungry.

376
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,278
那样说你能接受吗
Does that make sense?

377
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:38,780
喂? 喂?
Hello? Hello?

378
00:15:39,983 --> 00:15:41,616
哦 那是Doolittle夫人吗
Oh, was that Mrs. Doolittle?

379
00:15:41,651 --> 00:15:43,151
是的  然后?
Yeah. - And?

380
00:15:43,219 --> 00:15:45,086
非常情绪化  哦 当然
- Very emotional. - Well, of course.

381
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,988
没错
<i>Yeah.</i>

382
00:15:47,022 --> 00:15:48,856
什么?   哦 苍天啊
What? Oh, Jesus.

383
00:15:48,891 --> 00:15:50,725
好吧 Amy 我们会派Dan
All right, Amy, we're gonna have to get Dan

384
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,995
去明尼苏达 做些寡妇的工作
to go to Minnesota, do some widow work.

385
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:55,931
Dan在停职中  是 我他妈知道他在停职
- Dan's on furlough. - Yeah, I know he's fucking furloughed

386
00:15:55,966 --> 00:15:57,533
因为是我他妈给他停的职
because I'm the fucker who furloughed him.

387
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,601
顺便问 Gary呢?
And by the way, where is Gary?

388
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:01,136
还在处理垃圾
He's still getting the garbage.

389
00:16:01,171 --> 00:16:02,638
哦 好吧 如果他不能尽快回来
Well, okay, if he's not back soon,

390
00:16:02,739 --> 00:16:04,440
我们要终止使Sue停职
we're gonna have to unenfurlough Sue.

391
00:16:04,474 --> 00:16:05,841
Unenfur...

392
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,509
终止使...  我们得把Sue召回来 好吧
<i- >- - we'll have to get Sue back. Okay.

393
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:10,312
没错 还有我要见Furlong
Yeah. And I want to meet with Furlong.

394
00:16:13,316 --> 00:16:14,849
想都别想 我不会进去的
It's not happening. I'm not getting in there.

395
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:16,151
难以置信
Unbelievable.

396
00:16:16,219 --> 00:16:18,187
哦 上帝啊
Oh, God!

397
00:16:18,221 --> 00:16:21,456
哦 拜托 拜托 你觉得这很糟?
Oh, please. Please. You think this is bad?

398
00:16:21,491 --> 00:16:24,960
等你到了伦敦 所有东西闻起来都有股尿骚味
Wait till you get to London. Everything smells like urine.

399
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:26,594
连食物也是
Even the food.

400
00:16:26,662 --> 00:16:28,496
好吧 找到了
Okay, found it.

401
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,398
你怎么知道这是她的?  闭嘴 我找到了
- How do you know it's hers? - Shut up. I found it.

402
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:36,738
哦 上帝啊 这披萨真不错
Oh, my God, that pizza was good.

403
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:38,574
你知道的 我不怎么吃披萨 Roger
You know, I don't eat pizza very much, Roger.

404
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:41,743
但是当我吃的时候 那让我太他妈的高兴了
But when I do, it just makes me so fucking happy.

405
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:44,913
为此感谢中国人吧  什么?
Thank the Chinese for that. - What?

406
00:16:44,948 --> 00:16:46,882
中国人发明了披萨 (有此一说)  不 他们没有
- The Chinese invented pizza. - No, they didn't.

407
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,950
是的 是他们  听着 Roger
- Yeah, they did. - Listen, Roger,

408
00:16:48,985 --> 00:16:51,619
来谈谈现在到处传播的
let's talk about all these stories going around

409
00:16:51,654 --> 00:16:54,723
所有关于Andrew的土地交易和我们的关系的故事
about Andrew's land deal and our relationship.

410
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:57,391
哦 天哪 所有的这些流言 谣传
Oh, my God, all these whispers, these rumors.

411
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:58,993
谁知道这些都是哪来的?
Who knows where any of that's coming from?

412
00:16:59,027 --> 00:17:01,962
关键是这样的料非常非常多
The point is there's boxes and boxes of this stuff out there.

413
00:17:01,997 --> 00:17:03,664
这个我知道 那是事实  嗯哼
- I know that. That's a fact. - Uh-huh.

414
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:06,300
就像Will阳痿一样的事实
That's as much a fact as Will's impotence.

415
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:08,436
我不认为那合适
I don't think that's appropriate.

416
00:17:08,504 --> 00:17:09,971
他不介意 对吧 Will?
He doesn't mind. Do you, Will?

417
00:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,273
怎样都行 先生
Whatever works, sir.

418
00:17:11,307 --> 00:17:13,242
对吧 瞧? 好队员  没错
<i>- Right, see? Team player. - Yeah.</i>

419

我不知道 那搞不好会看起来很投机
I don't know. It could look opportunistic.

509

See, they're thinking like it's the 1990s.

我的思维已经到了2020年
I'm thinking like it's the 2020s.

你知道 在其他人搞砸它之前
You know, I didn't realize how good I was at this job

530
00:21:39,045 --> 00:21:40,780
我没意识到我在这份工作上做得有多棒
until someone else did it so badly.

531
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:42,948
差异不是不好  不 不好就是不好

别告诉我你搞上了那个寡妇

告诉我实情 你觉得Selina前途如何?

584
00:23:44,542 --> 00:23:47,178
土地交易的破事 假复合的破事 政府停工的破事
Land deal shit, fake relationship shit, shutdown shit.

女士 很抱歉

590
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,524
我没法帮您搞定那寡妇

591
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:02,993
哦 那就是我说的他妈的巨大的失败
Yeah, that was what I would call a massive fuckup.

592
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,195
是的  好吧 报纸们在说

593
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:08,598
我得为某个蠢货的恐怖死亡而负责
that I am responsible for the grisly death of some idiot.

594
00:24:08,632 --> 00:24:10,433
但是我正在去垃圾站的路上
But I'm on my way to a garbage dump,

595
00:24:10,501 --> 00:24:12,368
所以这是正面的 对吧?
so that's a positive, right?

596
00:24:12,403 --> 00:24:13,836
哦 这个态度不错
Well, that's a good attitude to have.

597
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:15,404
Amy 为什么除了我之外
Amy, why is everybody else

598
00:24:15,439 --> 00:24:16,839
每个人都在决定我的形象?
in charge of my image except me?

599
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:19,208
我们得做些什么 Amy  好吧
- We've got to do something, Amy. - Okay.

600
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:21,676
女士 那个垃圾场在10点15分的时候会有 被污染的淤泥运到
Ma'am, the dump has a contaminated sludge delivery at 10:15,

601
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,144
所以我们的时间有限
so we have a very limited window.

602
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,513
好吧 我只是 我只是想...
Okay, I just... I just want to think...

603
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,983
我们只需要用我们的大脑思考一分钟
we just need to think with our heads for a minute.

604
00:24:30,351 --> 00:24:31,585
或许让我上电视?
Maybe get me on TV?

605
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,321
哦 我们不想要上Janet Ryland的
Well, we don't want to do First Response

606
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,156
第一反应什么之类的  但是...
with Janet Ryland or anything, but I mean...

607
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,459
哦 哦 没错

608
00:24:38,494 --> 00:24:40,395
没错 是个绝妙的主意
Yeah, that's a great idea.

609
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:41,630
那就是我想做的 Dan
That's precisely what I want to do, Dan.

610
00:24:41,664 --> 00:24:43,565
好  哦 好吧 那么 是 就是这样
- Good. - Oh, okay, then, yes. Exactly.

611
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:44,866
你知道吗? 我想得越多
You know what? The more I think about it,

612
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:47,069
她就越接近我们想做的
she actually might be exactly what we want to do.

613
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:49,504
她被尊敬 但她并不危险
She's respected, but she's not dangerous.

614
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:51,173
她保守 她庄重
She's staid, she's stately.

615
00:24:51,207 --> 00:24:53,475
她又老又冷漠
She's old and cold

616
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,444
而我友好又...
and I'm warm and...

617
00:24:55,478 --> 00:24:57,947
年轻?  年轻 没错
- Young? - Young, exactly.

618
00:24:57,981 --> 00:24:59,648
而且我是个母亲
And I'm a mother.

619
00:24:59,683 --> 00:25:01,150
那么我们应该找来Catherine
So we should round up Catherine,

620
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:02,484
在关键时刻 必要的时候
at gunpoint, if we have to.

621
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:04,620
也许还有Andrew
And maybe Andrew.

622
00:25:04,654 --> 00:25:06,221
嗯?
Yeah?

623
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,991
诚实地说 全美国都会在看
Honestly, all of America will be watching.

624
00:25:09,025 --> 00:25:11,961
如果那不能实现 这就会是整个旅程的终点
If it doesn't land, then this could be the end to this whole adventure.

625
00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:13,429
别这样 别这样
Come on. Come on.

626
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:15,398
一惊一乍的女人  滴答 滴答

627
00:25:15,432 --> 00:25:18,068
淤泥时间  哦 这会是个绝妙的主意
<i>- Sludge time. - Yeah. This is gonna be a great idea.</i>

628
00:25:18,102 --> 00:25:20,837
那么打电话给第一反应  让这件事进行下去
So call First Response, get this thing underway.

629
00:25:20,871 --> 00:25:22,439
我们得终止使Mike和Gary停职
We've got to unenfurlough Mike and Gary.

630
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:24,742
是终止停职  那就是我刚说的 Amy
- Unfurlough. - That's what I just said, Amy.

631
00:25:24,776 --> 00:25:28,246
好吧? 尽可能找更多的人做这件事
Okay? So let's just throw as many bodies at this as we can.

632

这就是我们要做的
That's what we're gonna do.

633
00:25:31,951 --> 00:25:34,620
你或许希望戴着这个口罩以防风向改变

If you need it, you got it.

647
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,352

649
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:09,725
我在想这个垃圾场会如何影响到它们的生活
I wonder how it's impacted by this very facility.

650
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,028
我们有很多老鼠 如果您指的是那个的话
We get a lot of rats, if that's what you mean.

你有被这个差异困扰过吗?
Do you find this divergence troubling?

660
00:26:38,786 --> 00:26:40,287
女士 我 我只铲垃圾

这看起来不怎么样 对吧?
This doesn't look great, does it?

663
00:26:45,927 --> 00:26:48,194
取决于你看的是哪个频道
Depends on which channel you're watching.

664

我想我们都能从你表现出来的无比的坚强中学习
I think we can all learn from the incredible strength you've shown.

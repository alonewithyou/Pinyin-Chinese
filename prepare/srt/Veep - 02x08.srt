瞧 很简单的一件事
Look, this is a walk in the park.

5
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,090
就是朋友间的随便聊聊 愉快的那种
This is a nice casual conversation between two friends.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,230
今天 全美国都是你家的客人 - 欢迎光临 美国人民
Today, America is a guest in your home.  Welcome, America.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,350
要记住 Janet比你更需要这个
The thing to keep in mind is Janet needs this more than you do.

8
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:37,530
大实话 我是说 她现在没那么红了
That is so true. I mean, she's kind of a lightweight now.

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,040
我们是在帮她的忙 - 她不中用了
We're doing her a favor.  She's a dud.

10
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,380
知道吗? 我们得做准备了 准备时间 去吧
You know what? We got to prep. Prep time, let's go.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,230
好 - 那首得罪了半个欧洲的歌曲?
Okay.  The song that offended half of Europe?

12
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,950
那没有得罪半个欧洲
It didn't offend half of Europe.

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,110
好吧 成 我得说 Janet
Okay, fine. Well, I have to tell you, Janet,

14
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,900
那只是个轻松的戏仿之作
that was a lighthearted parody.

15
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,010
竞选游说时你和Andrew一直在微笑
On the campaign trail, you and Andrew were all smiles,

16
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,410
但背后你们俩就跟一山不容二虎似的
but behind the scenes you were fighting like snakes in a bag.

17
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,630
你是个骗子和说谎者 女士
You're a fraud and a liar, ma'am.

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,410
喔 什么? 你在做什么? - 我在攻击你
Wow. What? What are you doing?  I'm hitting you.

19
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,850
伙计们 我们准备的是吹捧式访问 可不是吐槽大会
Guys, we're prepping for a puff piece, not for a roast.

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,980
没错 顺便问 她穿什么?
Right. What is she wearing, by the way?

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,980
藏青色西装外套
She's wearing a navy jacket.

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,350
保守而绝望
It's conservative and desperate at the same time.

23
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,340
啊? 看我穿的是什么
What? Look at what I'm wearing.

24
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,900
我们知道她要穿什么吗? 能弄清楚吗?
Do we know what she's wearing yet? Can we find out?

25
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:15,590
我们马上就进去了
We are gonna go in there in just a moment.

26
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:17,200
他们等着我们吹捧 - 没错
They're expecting a puff piece.  Right.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,330
开场我们假意吹捧一下
There's the bluff puff which we're gonna start out with.

28
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,330
你是她的朋友 你们上同一所高中
You're her friend. You went to high school together.

29
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,820
你们相互喜欢 然后马上切换到暗讽
You guys like each other. Then we switch right over to rough puff.

30
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,310
没人比你更会暗讽
Nobody does rough puff like you.

31
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,230
呃 就是那样的暗讽
Rrr. Give me that rough puff.

32
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,870
- 好吧 吹牛老爹 (艺人名 puff双关) - 唔
All right, Puff Daddy.  Ooh.

33
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,420
这人在干什么? - 他在移动一只没腿的马
What is this one doing? He is moving a legless horse.

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,480
哦 Catherine - Ryland小姐
Oh, Catherine.  Miss Ryland.

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:39,250
能见到你真是太荣幸了 - 很高兴见到你
It is such an honor to meet you.
-It's a pleasure to meet you.

36
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,690
我是你的大粉丝 - 谢谢
I'm such a fan of yours.  Thank you.

37
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,890
实际上我想学广播新闻

38
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,240
现在我学习的是影视研究和后现代舞蹈
Right now I'm studying film studies and postmodern dance.

39
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,670
真不错 拍摄开始的时候我们得聊聊这个 - 我会很高兴的
How wonderful. We'll have to talk about that <i> when the cameras are rolling.  I would love that.</i>

40
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,690
我正在上一节很酷的课 课上我们通过动作来辩论时下议题
I'm taking this really cool class where we sort of debate current issues through movement.

41
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,960
来把你的麦克风装好 - 哦
Let's get you miked up.  Oh.

42
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,110
哦 天哪 这是个问题
Oh, my God. This is a problem.

43
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,880
瞧这个 - 你是说鼓鼓囊囊的么?
Look at this.  For the poof, you mean?

44
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,160
把你的手放口袋里
Put your hands in your pockets.

45
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,480
如果把手放口袋里 我看上去就像在自慰
Looks like I'm masturbating if I got my hands in my pockets.

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,850
用张毯子挡一下 还是那样太像罗斯福了? (有腿疾)
Put the blanket over it, or is that too FDR?

47
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:08,010
你们能跪下来吗?
Can you guys please kneel down?

48
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:11,860
因为我觉得我像是掉井底了似的 这让我脖子好痛
'Cause I feel like I fell into a well or something <i>and it's hurting my neck.</i>

49
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,740
好吧 他们会提到那个漂筏旅行
Okay, they're gonna bring up the rafting trip.

50
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,110
哦 我把我的前夫拖倒河里
Well, I took my ex down to the river

51
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,000
用石头砸他的头然后溺...
and I tried to smash his head in with a rock and then drown-

52
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,730
这是Cody Marshall
This is Cody Marshall.  Cody Marshall.

53
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,350
他是第一反应的制片人 - 你好 Cody Marshall
<i> He's the producer for "First Response. "  Hi, Cody Marshall.</i>

54
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:28,070
抱歉 我是否打扰了你们的集体祷告? - 只是高度调整什么的
I'm sorry, am I interrupting a team prayer meeting? We're just doing a height thing.

55
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,680
没什么 - 哦 祝好运 各位
<i> It was nothing.  Okay. Good luck, everyone.</i>

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,230
非常感谢 你真好心 谢谢
Thank you so much. Very kind. Thank you.

57
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,950
感谢你的到来 我们很感激
Thanks for being here. We really appreciate it.

58
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:38,550
好了 她穿的是一条蓝裙子 就好像她把花吐了满身一样
Okay, she's wearing a bluish dress like she vomited flowers all over herself.

59
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,880
她就像个邋遢的图书馆管理员 - 哦 好
She's kind of a frumpy librarian.  Okay. All right.

60
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,660
哦!太好了 我们有生意了 - 什么?
Yes! All right, we're in business.  What?

61
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,380
刚刚确认了有一封泄露邮件
Just confirmed a leaked e-mail.

62
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,360
她前夫为了商业利益承诺可以接近副总统
Her ex-husband promising access for business favors.

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,690
他真的在吹嘘这个 - 我知道
He actually brags about it.  I know.

64
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,520
这太讨厌了 - 吹嘘可以接近副总统
It's almost too painful.  Brags about access.

65
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,460
你先装友好让她失去防备 然后来个大反转狠狠地咬她几口
Just drag her in with the kindness, then turn great white and start taking chunks out of her.

66
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,940
她可不够我吃的
She's not much of a meal.

67
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,610
哦 是Greg?
Oh, is it Greg?  Gary.

68
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,350
Gary 我们都准备好了 所以如果你可以...
Gary, we're all set up, so if you can...

69
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,540
哦 好极了 嗯
Yeah, great. Yeah.

70
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:06,740
副总统女士
Madam Vice President.  Janet Ryland.

71
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,040
哦 我想我们最后一次见面是在...
Gosh, I think the last time that we saw each other was at the...

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,680
白宫记者协会年度晚宴 - 白宫记者协会年度晚宴
The Correspondents' Dinner.  The Correspondents' Dinner.

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,030
没错 我觉得你又长高了
That's right. I think you've grown since then.

74
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,660
不是那样就是你变矮了
Either that or you've gotten shorter.

75
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,520
哦 呃... - 不 是我 我穿了高跟鞋
Oh, well... No, it's me. I've got heels on.

76
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
哦 不管怎样 真高兴你能来
Well, anyway, I'm so happy you're here.

77
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,850
那么你觉得这里还成吧
So you found the joint okay.

78
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,520
哦 当然 我想这是我们第四次副总统访问了
Oh, yeah, I think this is our fourth vice presidential interview.

79
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,610
真的吗? - 嗯
Is that so?  Mm-hmm.

80
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,140
之前的三次都完美极了 所以不要有压力
The three of them were excellent, so no pressure.

81
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,460
他在对我说 - 哦
He's talking to me.  Okay.

82
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,690
那么计划是什么? 我们要做些什么?
So what is the plan, then? What are we going to do?

83
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,020
哦 我想我们首先会稍微展示一下这间屋子
Well, we'll start, I think, just with a little walk around the room.

84
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,570
然后是正式的访问 我想 就在这
And then the formal interview, I thought, right here.

85
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,120
哦 这里? 哦 - 是的
Oh, right here? Okay.  Yeah.

86
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,430
但那就是说这个得移开
But that means that this has to go.

87
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,710
我以为你们会在那边做
I thought you were doing it over there.

88
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,720
不 之前是 不过我们会在这里做 这里也很好
No, we did, but we're gonna do it here, and that's perfectly fine.

89
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,960
所以我们会把那倒霉玩意拿走
So we'll get that poor thing away.

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,450
随便了 你有见过我的女儿吗?
Anyway, have you met my daughter?

91
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,700
你真的收到了我最后一封关于讨论话题的邮件了吗?
So you did get my final e mail on topics?

92
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,730
没 但是我的垃圾邮件过滤器收到了 - 认真点 你收到了吗?
No, but my spam filter did.  Seriously, did you get it?

93
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,060
我有吗?
Did I?

94
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,100
嘿 都搞定了 让我们来创造历史吧 伙计们
Yeah, we're all set. Let's make some history here, folks.

95
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:05,920
好了 开始摄像
<i>Okay, roll cameras.</i>

96
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:09,720
十分感谢您邀请我们来您家 副总统女士
Thank you so much for inviting us into your home today, Madam Vice President.

97
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,450
哦 这是我的荣幸
Oh, well, it's certainly my pleasure.

98
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,620
我想 聊聊哪些是原装的
I thought it might be fun to talk about what's original

99
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,980
哪些是后来加上去的会很有意思
and what's been augmented over the years.

100
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,030
我们说的是这栋建筑 对吧?
We're talking about the building, right?

101
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,340
因为我就是原装的 - 您当然是
Because I'm original.  You certainly are.

102
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,430
不 没错 就是这栋建筑 女士 - 是的
No, yes, the building, ma'am.  Yes.

103
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:30,400
这栋建筑本身是安妮王朝式样 (18世纪英国的建筑和家具式样)
<i>The building itself is Queen Anne style.</i>

104
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,980
这当中的很多东-塞 呃 东西
Many of the objay-ects objects

105
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:37,200
事实上 都来自于海军中的老家伙们
are from the good old boys in the Navy, as a matter of fact.

106
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,370
真的? - Jolly Jack Tars (海军的昵称)
Really?  Jolly Jack Tars.

107
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,460
打个比方 这个 这个小望远镜 或者望远镜
For instance, this this spyglass here, or telescope-

108
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,680
能看到间谍
To see spies.

109
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,220
但愿吧? - 哦 既然您提到了
If only, right? You know, since you brought it up,

110
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,990
您介意评论一下
would you care to comment on the CIA operative

111
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,350
在乌兹别克斯坦被和学生一起解救的中情局特工吗?
rescued with the students in Uzbekistan?

112
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,500
哦 我真的 我不知道该说什么
Well, I really I wouldn't know what to say

113
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,550
因为此时调查仍没有结论
because at this point the investigation is pending.

114
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,860
这一件
Now this here

115
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,910
是一件令人惊讶的导航工具
is a stunning sort of navigational device.

116
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,140
我只是认为您大概会想说说
I just thought you might want to comment

117
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:11,390
他是如何使那些年轻学生的生命受到威胁的
on how he endangered the lives of those young students.

118
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:14,060
但是 我在调查之前做出判断
But it would be wrong and unethical

119
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,060
不但是错误的 也是缺乏职业道德的
for me to prejudge the investigation.

120
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,800
这个是铃
This is a bell.

121
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,700
我们能取些你和Janet在门厅里走过的景吗?
Can we get some shots of just you and Janet walking in the hallway?

122
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,830
当然 - 不取声音
Sure.  No sound.

123
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,490
我们只是取些远景
We're gonna just do some establishing shots.

124
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:30,230
我们会放上她的旁白 - 我们会在之后加上去
We'll put her voice over  We'll lay that in later.

125
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:33,080
哦 好 - 开拍
<i> Yeah, okay.  And action.</i>

126
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,440
哦 我想我们打过招呼 说间谍的事是绝对不能提的 对吧?
Yeah, I thought we said that the spy thing was completely off-limits, you know?

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,330
我很抱歉 在我看来
I'm sorry, it seemed to me-

128
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:42,310
我十分希望那会是
I'm really hoping that that's gonna be

129
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:46,640
最后也是唯一的陷阱问题
the last and only gotcha question.

130
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,950
只是我以为你希望我把它提出来
It just seemed to me that you were wanting me to bring it up.

131
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,600
不 一点也不
No, that wasn't the case at all.

132
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,480
我明白你为什么这么紧张 - 不 我不紧张 Janet
I understand why you're tense. No, I'm not tense, Janet.

133
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,230
连丝毫的紧张感都没有
I'm not even remotely tense.

134
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,020
只是不想让访问出岔子
Just trying to get this done right.

135
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:04,690
唔 - 这是以前某些人弄上的破玩意 我不知道是谁
Mm-hmm.  This is some old shit by somebody, I don't know who it is.

136
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,120
这房子闹鬼吗? - 哦 天哪 我不知道
Is this house haunted?  Oh, God, I don't know.

137
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,150
说实话 我讨厌这栋房子 就像生活在洋娃娃监狱里一样
I hate this house, to tell you the truth. It's like living in a doll's jail.

138
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:13,850
Cynthia 能给我些别针么? - 好的 来搞定它
<i> Cynthia, could I get clips?  Okay, let's settle.</i>

139
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,320
把背后清空 麻烦 - 这能凸显你的曲线
<i> Clear the background, please.  Gives you a nicer line.</i>

140
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,670
哦 是吗? - 你不需要别针 你的身材很棒
Oh, really?  You don't need clips. Your shape is great.

141
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,400
不过这个呢? - 哦 天哪
But what about this?  Oh, my God.

142
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,570
好吧 这儿 把它折起藏在下面 把手这样放着
Okay, here, let's tuck this under. Put your hands like this.

143
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,160
但这看起来像我胃在痛 - 非常感谢
But that looks like I have a stomachache.  Thank you so much.

144
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,180
好了 开拍吧
Okay, let's roll cameras.

145

每个人都准备好了 谢谢 Glen
Everybody settle in here. Thank you, Glen.

146
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,250
声音? - 在录音
<i> Sound?  Sound speeding.</i>

147
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,960
那么我们开始了
And we are rolling.

148
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,460
知道吗 我觉得有些暗
You know what? I'm feeling a little bit dark.

149
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,100
哦 就是想...
Yeah, just want to...

150
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,700
Gary 我们能把那灯弄过来吗
Gary, can we get that light back?

151
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,450
抱歉 请把灯移回去
Sorry, let's move that light back.

152
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,920
能给副总统几盏灯么?
Can we get a couple of lights for the vice president?

153
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,470
哦 我得临时从屁股里拉出来（想一想）
Yeah, let me just pull that out of my ass.

154
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,580
这里是特区 你可以找到周日会开放屁股的人
It's DC. You can find someone willing to open their ass on a Sunday.

155
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,190
很好 祝你好运 正在录音
Great, good luck. Sound is speeding.

156
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,920
每个人都各就各位了 他们看起来棒极了
Everyone is set and settled. They look great.

157
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,830
开拍
And rolling.

158
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,160
你有读过Randall Howard的书
Have you read Randall Howard's

159
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,870
《权力之心： 特区最有影响力的夫妇》吗?
Hearts of Power: DC's Most Influential Couples?

160
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,850
遗憾地说 我没有很多时间去读小说
Sadly, I don't have a lot of time to read fiction.

161
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,240
那么 在选举期间
<i>Now, during the election,</i>

162
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,820
有一些关于你和你前夫Andrew之间
there were reports of screaming matches

163
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,170
争吵的报告
with you and your ex-husband Andrew

164
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:22,710
还有那些微笑和感情的展示
and suggestions that the smiles and shows of affection

165
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,120
都是在摄像机前做戏的说法
<i>were all faked for the camera.</i>

166
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,400
你们的感情都是为了作秀吗?
<i>Was your friendship all for show?</i>

167
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,420
完全不是
Absolutely not.

168
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,670
瞧 Andrew陪着我去竞选游说
Now, Andrew was on the campaign trail with me,

169
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:35,650
是因为他真的认同 并且现在仍然认同
really, because he shared, and still does share,

170
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,630
我对美国未来的展望 - 哦
my vision for America.
<i> Okay.

171
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,920
我们需要重新安排一下照明
-We'd like to reset for lighting.</i>

172
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,340
我们要重设照明 - 很快
We're gonna reset for lighting.  Just a quick lighting reset.

173
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,940
还有说实在的 她可以结束Andrew这个话题换另外的
And, really, she can move on from Andrew.

174
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,260
我是说 她可以想问几次就问几次
I mean, she can push as much as she likes,

175
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,390
但是你们只会得到同样的答案 所以...
but you're just gonna get the same answer, so...

176
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,890
唔 你有看过电视新闻吗?
Hmm, have you seen television news before?

177
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,640
没有 不过我希望圣诞节的时候能得到一套设备
No, I am hoping to get the box set for Christmas, though.

178
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,250
听起来就是那样 - 嗯哼
That's what it feels like.  Uh-huh.

179
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,660
嗯? 抱歉
What? Excuse me.

180
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,810
哦 - 喂?
Okay.  Yes?

181
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:03,340
你在... - 过来

182
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,790
为什么? 你为什么要打电话? - 过来一下
Why? Why are you calling me?  Come here.

183
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:09,930
天 你可能还想从他妈的报纸上剪两个洞窥视
Jesus, you might as well cut out eyeholes and peer through a fucking newspaper.

184
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:13,100
你他妈的在干什么? - 现在是世界末日
What the fuck are you doing? It's "Apocalypse Now. "

185
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,330
有封Andrew给说客的邮件
There's an e-mail from Andrew to a lobbyist.

186
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:17,360
他宣称可以提供接近Selina的最佳门路
He's claiming super access to Selina.

187
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,090
他在吹嘘 - 这个?
He's bragging about it.  This?

188
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,940
就是他妈的Andrew 哦
It's fucking Andrew, yeah.

189
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,650
副总统女士 - 嗯? 嗯?
Madam Vice President.  Yes? Yes?

190
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,910
你前夫Andrew有任何政治上的抱负吗?
Does your ex-husband Andrew have any political aspirations?

191
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,510
哦 天哪 - 我们得告诉她
Oh, my goodness.  We've got to tell her.

192
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,930
我们得告诉她 - 不行 不行 不行 别对Selina说一个字
We've got to tell her.  No, no, no, don't say anything to Selina.

193
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:32,460
为什么? - 因为Janet在这
Why?  'Cause Janet's right there.

194
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,050
你不认为我们在她耳边说的时候她会注意到?
You don't think she's gonna notice we're whispering in her ear?

195
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,190
然后她会赶紧让这个没种的男人去查
Then she gets on and she tells this dildo to look it up.

196
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,050
然后我们就有了个该死的故事 - 怎么了?
And then we have a fucking story.  What's going on?

197
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:41,220
Andrew又混蛋了 - 他从各个方面把我们弄得一团糟
Andrew's fucking us again.
-He's screwed us in all known dimensions.

198
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,790
什么新消息? - 另一个丑闻
What's new?  Another scandal.

199
00:08:43,170 --> 00:08:46,750
对 但这是个他妈的很糟糕的破事 - 他就是政治毒药 他是政治
Yeah, but this is fucking bad shit. He's political poison. He's political-

200
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,380
你好 Andrew
Hi, Andrew.  Andrew.

201
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,140
他一生都在做商业地产
He's been in commercial real estate his entire life.

202
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,990
所以没有任何理由可能存在跨界的现象?
So there's no reason there would be should be a crossover?

203
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,420
哦 我当然无法 呃
Well, I certainly couldn't, you know,

204
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:59,450
替他回答这个问题
answer that question for him.

205
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,630
那么对不久前
Would it surprise you to learn that only moments ago

206
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:05,020
一个博客报道你的前夫
a blog has reported that your ex-husband

207
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,950
向某个说客承诺有接近你的门路的事情感到惊讶吗?
promised a lobbyist favorable access to your office?

208
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,600
这确实存在于一封来自你丈夫的真实邮件... - 哦 我知道了 哦
It does exist in an actual e-mail  from your ex-husband to..  Oh, I see. Okay.

209
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,660
你好 Jim 记得吗 我能直达天听
Hi, Jim. Remember, I have the vice president's ear

210
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,460
并且有各种接近她的门路
and I can get all kinds of access to her.

211
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,740
后面跟着一个眨眼的表情符号
<i>And then there's one of those winking emoticons</i>

212
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,260
就在结尾处
<i>at the bottom there.</i>

213
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,190
我猜那可能表示那是玩笑话
I'm guessing that that was meant as some sort of a joke.

214
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:35,840
你知道 Andrew Meyer对于我的决定没有任何...
You know, Andrew Meyer has no influence whatsoever

215
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,610
影响力
over my decision-making.

216
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,780
这很难相信 因为你刚描述了一种
It's hard to believe because you've just painted a picture

217
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,240
你们的关系非常亲近 极其亲近的画面
of your relationship being very close, extremely close.

218
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,460
我们没有心灵感应
We're not telepathically linked.

219
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,970
他读不了我的心 - 嘿 已经15分钟了
<i> He can't read my mind.  Hey, that's our 15 minutes.</i>

220
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,080
十五分钟到了 好 好
<i>That's the 15-minute mark. Great. Great.</i>

221
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,570
休... - 哦!休息一会 休息一会吧
Let's take a  Oh! Let's take a break,let`s take a break.

222
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,550
天!
God!

223
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,990
哦 - 你还好吧 Gary?
<i> Okay.  Are you okay, Gary?</i>

224
00:09:56,990 --> 00:09:58,380
哦 哦 我很好
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

225
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:01,140
抱歉 我能调整一下你的麦克风吗
Sorry, could I just adjust your radio mike?

226
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,340
我这里有些静电干扰 - 好了
I'm getting some static.  I got it.

227
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,080
喔 哇哦! 喂 我靠耳朵吃饭的
Ow! Whoa! Okay, my ears are my livelihood.

228
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,140
你不需要 - 哦 肯定
You don't need to  Okay, I bet.

229
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,100
好了 退开吧
All right. Let's just back off.

230
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,780
我知道现在你想杀了某个人...
I know that you want to kill somebody right now...

231
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,560
- 是的 - ...不幸的是那不能是这屋子里的任何一个人
Yeah.  ... but unfortunately it can't be anyone in the building.

232
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,130
好吗? - 好的
Okay?  Okay.

233
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,520
Selina告诉我谁会来采访我的时候 你就没法摆脱我了
When Selina told me who was gonna be interviewing me,
you couldn't keep me away.

234
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,100
等会再和你聊 - 棒极了
Talk to you a little later on.  Wonderful.

235
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,680
我很期待 - 我也是
I look forward to it.  I do, too.

236
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,810
不过先和我来一下 把你的形象处理一下
But let's take you now and get you all changed and fixed up.

237
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,400
我们结婚的时候 他在洗手间呆的时间比我还长
When we were married, he took longer in the bathroom than I did.

238
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,070
那不是事实 你为什么那么说? - 先进去
That's not true. Why would you say that?  Just get in here.

239
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,590
该死的这是什么? - 电线
What the hell is this thing?  That's a cable.

240
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:40,060
哦 去 - 有条电线
Oh, shit.  There's a cable.

241
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,550
听我说 你之前在想什么?
Listen to me. What were you thinking?

242
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,820
什么? 那只是玩笑
What? It was a joke.

243
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,320
又一次了 Andrew
Once again, Andrew, you have totally

244
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,760
你又让我大失所望
lived down to my expectations.

245
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:54,390
我邀请你来官邸来做爱的时候 我没有这个意思
When I invited you here to the residence to fuck me, I didn't mean this.

246
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,830
我们不是在互相利用吗? - 你在说什么?
Aren't we using each other? What are you talking about?

247
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:59,030
好吧 我仔细说明一下
Okay, I'll spell it out for you.

248
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:02,490
美利坚合众国的副总统
How easy is it for the Vice President of the United States

249
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:05,420
要临时来场性爱有多难 嗯?

<i>That's right, I am the Vice President of the United States</i>

253
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:17,420
而我决定不再和你做爱
and I choose now not to fuck you anymore.

257
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,790
啊哼 他就上去换个衣服
Ahem, he's gonna go just change.

258
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,810
等等 他去哪里? - 去拿我的东西
Wait, where's he going?  To get my stuff.

259
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,620
在我的卧室
In my bedroom.

260
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,220
哦 不 唔嗯

哦 Andrew有和副总统上床? 你知道?
Oh, Andrew's been veep-fucking? You knew about this?

262
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:38,740
好吧 这是他妈的最高级风暴
Okay, this is a category five shit storm.

263
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,850
她结束了 她完了 我走了
She's over. She's done. I'm gone.

264
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:47,030
唔 我在想是否能拍些Andrew进来的远景
<i>Um, I'm wondering if we can get just a shot</i> of Andrew's entrance just for establishing.

265
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:49,180
你们在这碰头 亲一亲 嗨 嗨
So you guys meet here, kiss, kiss, hi, hi.

266
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,510
就是家人聚在一起
It's a family getting together.

267
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:54,400
不 不 我了解什么是登场以及如何和人打招呼 我知道了
No, no, I understand what an entrance is and how to greet people. I get that.

268
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400

No, no, you're not gonna get this. I'm so sorry. We're not gonna do that.

271
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,890
我们可没有那种Seuss博士的书里描写的在阁楼的前门
We don't have a front door in our attic like in some sort of Dr. Seuss book or something.

272
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:08,930
有时候拍摄这些毫无准备的场景 就会引起紧张
Sometimes filming these off-guarded moments, things get a little tense.

273
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,230
哦 不 这压根不是紧张
Well, no, it's not tense at all.

274

这大概多久一次? - 哦 天哪
How often does this happen?  Oh, gosh.

280
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,420
每周一次我们聚在一起聊聊天吃吃饭什么的
Once a week we get together for a gab and a gobble.

281
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,360
是的 哦 我是说 你知道 如果时间什么的允许
Yeah, well, I mean, you know, schedules permitting and stuff

282
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:36,760
因为我现在真的当做自己和副总统办公室结了婚

日以继夜地工作来避免这次停工
through the night to avoid this shutdown.

285
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,170
当然那没有 那没有成功 很遗憾
And of course it wasn't it wasn't avoided, sadly.

286
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,640
您认为您本来可以更努力一点吗?
Do you think you could have worked a little harder on that?

287
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,490
哦 我们一直很努力
Well, we are working harder.

288
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,660
令人丧气 当然 - 当然
It's frustrating, of course.  Sure.

289
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,450
对美国民众来说的确如此 - 这是个很漫长的过程
To the American people it is.  It's a very long process.

哦 我刚刚结束和白宫的通话
Oh, I just got off the phone with the White House

and in 15 minutes POTUS is going to announce that the shutdown is over.

309
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,240

So you were expecting a solution today? Yes, I was, yes.

318

但你刚刚说那会是一个漫长的过程
And yet you said it was going to be a long process.

319
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,390
那的确是 没错 那是
And it was, yeah. It was.

320
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,470
你有参与...
Were you involved in the-

321
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:28,790
Janet 这就像你拧松了一个泡菜坛 然后有人过来打开了它
Janet, it's like when you loosen a pickle jar and somebody comes by and they just open it.

322
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,940
这就是拧松停工盖子的人
<i>This is the shutdown lid loosener.</i>

323
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:34,040
拧松泡菜坛盖子的人 - 我喜欢
The pickle jar loosener.  I like it.

324
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:37,280
哦 不过你能和我们讲讲这最终协议的事情吗?
No, but can you talk us through the final agreement?

我能 它 你知道
I can it's you know-

326
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,930
我能...但我也想用些午饭
I can and I also want to eat some lunch.

327
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,860
我们饿了吗?
Are we hungry?

328
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:47,200
唔唔 肯定的 - 没错 去吃午饭吧
<i> Mm-hmm, definitely.  Yeah, let's get some lunch.</i>

<i> Lunchtime.  That's a cut.</i>

331
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,340
哦 她不 - 哦 天哪 她不知道
Okay, she doesn't  Oh, my God, she didn't know.

332
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,280
那让我想起了我入行的原因
That reminded me why I got into this business.

333
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,070
我现在太为你着迷了
I am so attracted to you right now.

334
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,420
我就坐在这里然后看你们准备
I think that I'd like to just sit back and watch you all prepare this meal.

335
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,660
假装我不在这 - 唔嗯
Pretend I'm not here.  Mm-hmm.

336
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,400
我就是墙上的苍蝇
<i>I kind of want to be the fly on a wall.</i>

337
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,420
哦 天哪 Andrew 你弄得到处都是
Oh, my God. Andrew, that's getting everywhere.

338
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,110
唔 我得给你一只...
Um, I'm gonna get you a...

339
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,200
削皮器 好吗? - 我不需要削皮器 谢谢
peeler, okay?
I don't need a peeler. Thank you.

340
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,680
哦 你需要个削皮器 - 事实上 不
Yeah, you need a peeler.  Actually, I don't.

341
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,300
哪里 我在试图记起在哪 你知道那种你明明知道你厨房里有某样东西
Where I'm trying to remember where you know how sometimes you have something in your kitchen,

342
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,520
你知道它在哪 但突然就找不到了的情况吗?
you know where it is, and then all of a sudden you can't find it?

343
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,940
那就是我现在的情况
And that is what's happened to me right now.

344
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,580
哦 你大概有太多员工在这进进出出了吧
<i>Well, you probably have so much staff in and out of here-</i>

345
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,220
不 不 不 我了解这厨房就像了解我的手背一样
No, no, no. I know this kitchen like the back of my hand.

346
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,660
哦 不是这个
<i>Oh, that's not it.</i>

347
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,830
好吧 我不知道哪里
Okay, I don't know where-

348
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,040
这令人恼火 你有过这样的经历吗? 想找到什么但...
This is maddening. Do you ever have this happen to you where you're-try to find that

349
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:44,520
我不在这 - 好吧 你不在 抱歉
<i> I'm not here.  Okay, you're not here. I'm so sorry.</i>

350
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,260
我在自言自语 你在哪 削皮器? 哦 找到了
I'm talking to myself. Where are you, peeler? Okay, I got it.

351
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,830
费解的 它居然和纸巾放在一起
It was in with the napkins inexplicably.

352
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,940
给 用来刨胡萝卜
Here you go. Use that for the carrots.

353
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,250
事实上 我弄完了 我好了
Actually, I'm all done. I'm good.

354
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,220
好吧 - 说说 你难道不是通常让工作人员为你提供饮食吗?
Okay.  Tell me, don't you normally have staff  to cater for you?

355
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,860
没错 完全正确 - 哦 当然 不过我也喜欢捣鼓锅碗瓢盆
Yeah, definitely. Well, sure, but I just love banging the pots around.

356
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,850
我觉得我是个美食家
<i>And I think you would say that I'm a foodie.</i>

357
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:08,790
那么 只是提醒你一下
So, just to flag with you,

358
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,700
很明显 Andrew显然是不能问的 (离开饭桌)
Andrew's obviously off the table.

359
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,630
哦 技术上来说他现在完全是在桌旁啊
Well, technically he's very much at the table currently.

拜托 你能用那个削皮器吗?
<i>Please, can you use the peeler?</i>

371
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,000
我搞定胡萝卜了 - 哦 天哪
<i> I'm all done with the carrots.  Oh, my God.</i>

372
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,970
不 你没有 - 我们要用的胡萝卜就那么多
No, you're not.  That's all the carrots we're gonna use.

373
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,520
我知道还有多的胡萝卜
I realize there are more carrots.

374
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,320
我们不需要更多
<i>We don't need any more.</i>

375
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,340
那个动起来运动
The Get Moving campaign,

376
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,310
如你所知的 我是领头人 - 没错
which as you know I spearheaded.  Yes.

377
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,200
在我发起那项运动的时候
As I launched that campaign, I discovered

378
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,620
{\a6}(Catherine是素食者)
{\a9}CATHERINE IS VEGETARIAN!

379
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,660
我发现了一个当地的卖有机肉的肉商
a local organic butcher.

380
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,120
还有...
And...

381
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,930
他养了许多...
he does a lot of...

382
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,600
{\a6}她三个月前就告诉你了
{\a9}SHE TOLD YOU 3 MONTHS AGO!

383
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:03,720

用草料喂养的牛
Grass-fed cattle

385
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:08,310
还有放养的鸡 - 是的 是的
and free-range chickens.  Yeah. Yeah.

386
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:11,060
你等不及要吃的最爱是哪道菜?
<i>What's your favorite meal that you can't wait to have?</i>

387
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,730

烤球芽甘蓝
that my mom and dad make.

389
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:21,820
是的
Yep.

390
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,250
好了 他们去休息了
<i>Okay, well, they're taking a break,</i>

391
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:27,100
这让我们有机会在这谈一谈
so this gives us a chance to come in here, have a little chat.

392
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,030
你从未告诉我你是素食者
You never told me that you were a vegetarian.

393
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,610
我三个月前就告诉你了 - 不 你没有 Catherine
I told you three months ago.  No, you didn't, Catherine.

394
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,800
什么? - 现在她提到了 我想这听起来有些耳熟
What?  Now that she mentions it,  I think it does sound familiar.

395
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,790
完全是废话
It`s completely useless.

396
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:40,930
知道吗? 就因为他是个麻烦 不代表你也得是个麻烦
You know what? Just because he's a liability doesn't mean you have to be a liability, too.

397
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:42,770
我告诉你 你得吃鸡肉
Now I'm gonna tell you something. You're eating that chicken.

398
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,780
我不会做的 我是素食者 妈妈
I am not gonna do it. I'm a vegetarian, Mom.

399
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,100
你一生都在吞咽鸡肉
You swallowed chicken your entire life.

400
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,920
- 今天你得再这么做 - 我一辈子都在忍受(吞咽)你的破事
You're gonna do it again today. I swallowed your bullshit my entire life.

401
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,340
好了 瞧 小淑女 我们不对你妈那么说话
Okay, look, little lady, we don't talk to your mother like that.

402
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,100
好吧 我只是 去他妈的
All right, I'm just God damn it.

403
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,910
你能不能... - 是的 是的 是的
<i> Could you  Yes, yes, yes.</i>

404
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,590
你知道你十二岁刚刚戒掉那个的时候?
You know when you're 12 and you just get rid of it?

405

540
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,630
或许我可能
Perhaps it's possible

541
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:52,950
高估了自己的力量
that I have overplayed my hand.

542
00:23:52,950 --> 00:23:54,650
哦 我想可以这么说
<i>Well, I think it's safe to say</i>

543
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:57,390
Andrew手伸得太长
that Andrew overreached

544
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:00,170
说了些蠢话 没错
and just said something silly. Yeah.

545
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,460
我想副总统
I suppose that the vice president

546
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,510
也会同意
would also agree that

547
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:08,890
她说她有参与国家安全事务
when she said she was in the loop over national security,

548
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,200
也可能同样有些夸大
that also may have been an bit of an exaggeration.

549
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,220
事实上我不确定两者有可比性
I'm actually not sure that those two situations are comparable.

550
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,670
我相信有
I believe that they are.

551
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:24,370
由于你在调查结束前拒绝评论间谍指控和人质处境
And insomuch as you refuse to comment on the spy allegations or the hostage situation

552
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:28,810
我 同样的 也要回避
until the investigation is complete, I, too, would like to refrain

553
00:24:28,810 --> 00:24:30,840
直到我找出我被指控说过
until I find out just exactly what it is

554
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,600
或者没说过的究竟是什么
I'm accused of having said or not said.

555
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,070
你应该明白这听起来像是你在拖延时间
You do understand that sounds like you're playing for time

556
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:40,250
而且实际上是在掩盖着什么?
and actually are hiding something?

557
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,620
抱歉 这是给我还是Selina的问题?
I'm sorry, was that a question for me or Selina?

558
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,440
我想是给我的
I think that question is for me.

559
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,090
我想说说间谍的事情
I want to talk about the spy.

560
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:53,140
那个中情局特工
The CIA operative.

561
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,790
不 不 -  是的 是的
No, no.  Yeah, yeah.

562
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,810
有个失败的沟通是我想替政府表示歉意的
There was a miscommunication for which I want to apologize

563
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:00,730
on behalf of the administration.
on behalf of the administration.

564
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,490
你知道 误导美国人民从来都不是我们的意图
You know, the intention was never to mislead

565
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:07,640
但那是它的结果
the American people, but that was its effect.

566
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,840
去 - 为此 我很抱歉
<i> Shit.  And for that, I really am truly sorry.</i>

567
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,510
但我要说我完全了解间谍的状况
But I am saying that I had full knowledge of the spy's status.

568
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,290
但她没有 - 我知道
But she didn't.  I know.

569
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,990
副总统女士 这是个很重大的坦承
Madam Vice President, this is quite an admission.

570
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,790
唔 现在我已扮演起一个
Mm-hmm. I have taken on a role now,

571
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,460
在国家安全事务中的重要角色
an important role in national security

572
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,370
我为担起此职责而骄傲
and I take great pride in that responsibility.

573
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,350
瞧 有时你需要采取行动
Now, sometimes you have to act.

574
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,110
而你总是需要倾听
Always you have to listen.

575
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:38,590
因为在政治中
Because in politics,

576
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,740
骨气与心灵的高度
a backbone and a heart

577
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,790
取决于你的耳朵

578

有多棒
as your ears.

579

而我靠我的耳朵生活
And my ears are my livelihood.

走另一边 Mike  好的 好的
go another way, Mike.  Okay. Okay.

135
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,100
女士 女士 您觉得疼吗? 您痛吗?
Ma'am, ma'am, are you hurting? Are you in pain?

136
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
呃 我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

137
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,450
你有镜子吗?
Do you have a mirror?

138
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,340
没有  是的 你有
No.  Yes, you do.

139
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,980
我有些舒缓疼痛的贯叶连翘  如果您想要的话
I've got some St. John's Wort for pain relief if you want it.

140
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,190
我不想吃药
I don't want to take medication.

141
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,510
是草本的 来自大自然
It's herbal. It's from the earth.

142
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:00,210
您可以吃六片 不会有什么影响
You can take six, it won't affect you.

143
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,680
瞧那个
Look at that.

144
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,430
啊! 嗷!
Ah! Ow!

145
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,560
呃 副总统表示歉意 但她稍微有些晚点
Uh, the vice president apologizes, but she's slightly delayed.

146
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,900
她正和澳大利亚大使通话  澳大利亚大使?
She's stuck on a call with the Australian ambassador. The Australian ambassador?

147
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,580
真不错 这一条我还没听过呢
That's good. I've never heard that one before.

148
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,720
Sidney Purcell 见到你总是令人愉快 先生
Sidney Purcell, always a pleasure, sir.

149
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,020
不 事实上不愉快  不过你这么努力有加分
No, it's not, actually, but you get marks for trying.

150
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,280
但副总统情绪高涨
But the vice president is in great spirits.

151
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,410
她迫不及待地想和你们所有人见面 我去看看 看我是否能打断那个电话
She's buoyantly waiting to meet you all and I will go check, see if I can interrupt that call.

152
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,100
就像我说的 是个电话
Like I said, it's a call.

153
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,600
{\a9}退伍军人纪念堂
{\a9}veterans memorial hall

154
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,200
力量是灵活但坚定的
Strength is being flexible and steadfast.

155
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,140
它是活下来的柳树 而不是枯死的橡木
The living willow, not the dead oak.

156
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,350
我在伊拉克懂得了 我与战友之间那条通往尊敬的路是双向的
I learned in Iraq that the road to respect between me and my men ran two ways.

157
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:51,850
为了得到尊敬 你得付出尊敬
<i>In order to get respect, you have to give respect.</i>

158
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:55,790
当我向外看的时候 我看到很多张脸 但我只看到了一个国家
<i>When I look out, I see many faces,</i> <i>but I see only one nation</i>

159
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,400
一个有统一志向的国家
with one aspiration,

160
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:01,780
那个志向就是某一天希望可以一起梦想
and that aspiration is to one day hope to dream together.

161
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,300
有一天 我在St. Paul  不
<i> I met a young woman...  No.</i>

162
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,670
遇到了一个叫Juanita的年轻女性
<i>Named Juanita in St. Paul the other day.</i>

163
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:10,240
哦 去他的  当我问... 你知道她对我说了什么吗?
<i >  Oh, crap. And I asked... <i>You know what she said to me?</i>

164
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,160
Dan  这很尴尬
<i> Dan.  This is awkward.</i>

165
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,510
就像在狂欢放荡的时候吸引了你姐妹的注意  哦 我姐妹绝不会狂欢
Like catching your sister's eye at an orgy. Well, my sister would never be at an orgy.

166
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,310
太紧张了
Too uptight.

167
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,460
她会想要每个人的健康报告 然后败兴...  好吧
She would want health records from everyone  and just kill the momentum and...  Okay.

168
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:24,150
我对你很失望  这种行为我自己有不奇怪
I'm disappointed in you. This is behavior I would expect from myself.

169
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,390
但是你? 不行
But from you? Uh-uh.

170
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,050
咱们别废话了吧 我们都是为了Chung助阵来的
Let's cut the crap. We're both here for Chung.

171
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:31,220
那我们一起跳 Butch和Sundacne(《虎豹小霸王》)  他们不是都死了吗?
So we both jump together. You know, Butch and Sundance. Don't they both die?

172
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,090
不 跳的时候没死 结局的时候才死的
No, not when they jump. They die at the end.

173
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:39,460
嘿 Sue  Dan 副总统刚刚撞破了一扇玻璃门
Hey, Sue. Dan, the vice president just walked through a glass door.

174
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,050
她撞破了一扇玻璃门? 那是什么 密码?
She walked through a glass door? What is that, code?

175
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,250
不 不幸的是 不是 Dan 这是对刚才发生的事的平实描述
No, unfortunately, it is not, Dan. <i>It is a literal description of what just happened.</i>

176
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,630
她伤得不是很严重 谢谢询问  她撞破了一扇玻璃门?
And she's not too badly hurt. Thanks for asking. She walked through a glass door?

177
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,420
是的 那女人成为了她自己事业的一个活的象征
Yeah, that woman has become a living metaphor of her own career.

178
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,980
确保你今天休息 好吗?
Just make sure you rest today, okay?

179
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:03,820
我觉得自己就像个被补好 送给孤儿院孩子的旧橄榄球
I feel like one of those old used footballs that they fixed up for the kids at an orphanage.

180
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,060
看到你冷静下来了这很好  女士 足够的休息 明天不能跑一万米
Good to see you've calmed down. Ma'am, plenty of rest and no 10K run tomorrow.

181
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,120
好吗?  哦 这个可不行
Okay?  Well, I don't know about that.

182
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,400
呃 我们告诉每个人你晚点了
Uh, we told everyone you were delayed.

183
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,690
但我们得取消这个 好吗?  不 Mike 你在说什么?
But we're gonna have to cancel this thing, okay? No. Mike, what are you talking about?

184
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:21,710
我不能取消我的命运  女士 看 你正穿着浴袍
I can't cancel my destiny. Ma'am, look at you. You're wearing a robe.

185
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:25,800
除非你想下去为他们唱 《看着我 我是Sandra Dee》的副歌 您不能下楼
Unless you want to go down there and sing them a chorus of "Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee," you can't go downstairs.

186
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,190
好了 我先离开  非常感谢您的帮助
Okay, I'll go ahead and go. Thank you very much for your help.

187
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,620
保密?  哦 当然
Mum's the word?  Oh, yes.

188
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,780
好极了  我究竟该说什么?
Good.  What Would I even say?

189
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,430
我们就直接告诉他们发生了什么然后重新安排
We'll just tell them what happened and reschedule.

190
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,330
天哪  哦 天哪
<i> Jesus.  Oh, God.</i>

191
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:41,110
我去取消 我去取消
I'm cancelling. I'm cancelling.

192
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,530
好吧 她在哪?  我不知道
Okay, where is she?  I don't know.

193
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,850
我猜我们就跟着她的血迹还有Gary的泪痕
I guess we just follow the trail of her blood and Gary's tears.

194
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,630
哦 嘿  她有多糟糕?
Oh, hey.  How bad is she?

195
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:56,640
她没事 只是些表面割伤  你有给她吃止痛药或者...?
She's fine. It's just superficial cuts. Did you give her any painkillers or...?

196
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,300
你知道 我不想那么做 因为她已经吃了贯叶连翘
u konwI didn't want to do that because she's already on St. John's Wort.

197
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,890
我想某次我在一个天主教学校的女孩那听到过 (常用于舒缓痛经)
I think I got that off a Catholic schoolgirl once.

198
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,400
那么为什么她不能吃其他的药?  哦 那会对身体造成很坏的影响
So why can't she take anything else? Well, it can react badly with the body

199
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,720
如果她已经在服用免疫抑制剂 β-受体阻滞剂 或者抗抑郁剂
if she's already on immunosuppressants, beta-blockers, or antidepressants.

200
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,930
哦 哦 好吧 她没有吃其中的任何一种
<i>Oh, okay, fine. She's not on any of those.</i>

201
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,060
我得走了 稍后再和你们联系  哦 谢谢
I've really got to go. Catch you guys later. Yep, thank you.

Well, she is on antidepressants.  Yep.

你先请
After you.

204
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,740
瞧? 你让那个看起来很容易
See? You made that look so easy.

205
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:22,070
嘿 我很抱歉这不是总统套房 女士
Hey, I'm sorry this isn't the presidential suite, ma'am.

206
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,130
哦 没关系 Gary
Oh, it doesn't matter, Gary.

207
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,180
谁占了那个总统套房?
Who has the presidential suite?

208
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,890

I heard Russell Crowe.

Can you imagine him in this with his big mug?

214
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,970
是的 是的  到处转悠?
Yep, yep.  Walking around?

215
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,040

He'd love that.

Where'd you grow up?

我爸爸总是想有个男人一样的儿子 所以...
My dad always wanted a man for a son, so...

224
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,690
哦 是的  但时代不同了

时代不同了 这是事实
It is a different generation. It's true.

270
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,270
我猜它有趣是因为我们在某些时候都做过
I guess it's funny because we've all done it at one point.

271
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:14,160
我没有  我把某人推倒并撞破了平板玻璃门

你是副总统的联络人 对吧?
You are liaison to the VP, right?

That's your "liaison d'阾re"? I was born to liaise, sir.
那就是你"联络的理由 (仿法谚 存在的理由)"?  我生来就是做联络的 先生

那么为什么你不能告诉我副总统
Then why can't you tell me about what the VP was doing

278
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,180
撞破玻璃门的时候她在干什么?

好吧 呃 副总统办公室可以很不合作
Okay, well, the VP's office can be very insubordinate.

我是说 他们总是很抗拒我 你知道他们叫我Jo蛋蛋么?
I mean, they insubord me all the time. You know that they call me Jonad?

281
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,560
我是说 那就相当于叫总统Jo蛋蛋啊
I mean, that is tantamount to calling the president Jonad.

282
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:46,980
不 那不是 他是总统 你是Jo蛋蛋
No, it's not. He's the president, you're Jonad.

283
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,250
马上去那里从Sue嘴里问出事实
Now get in there and liaise the truth out of Sue

that she was meeting and greeting them? Uh, couldn't say.

297
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,410
如果你没法告诉我她当时在干什么
If you can't tell me what she was doing,

298
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,710

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,820
我已经把范围缩小到四套了
I've narrowed it down to four looks.

409
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,900
马上回来这里
Just get back here.

410
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,500
？？？Give me a number between one and four, please.
给我一到四当中的一个数 拜托

411
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,240
四  我想我更喜欢三
Four.  I think I prefer three.

412
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,650
那么去他的三  事实上 四不错
Fucking three, then.  Actually, four's good.

413
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,650
那么 谁会挑战这个总统?
So, who could challenge this president?

414
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,360
在此刻 我们听到的名字...
<i>At the moment, the names we're hearing...</i>

415
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,570
好吧 已经三个小时了
Okay, it has been three hours.

416
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,630
我需要她马上上电视
I need her on television now.

417
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:06,330
我需要给你画个线图吗 Jonah?
Do I need to draw you a line graph, Jonah?

418
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,980
多一点时间就少一点疯癫
More time equals less cuckoo.

419
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,930
我们需要让那些猜测迅速冷下来
We need to take a cold dump on the speculation.

420
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:13,320
她是那个会在两年后把帽子抛进决斗圈
Is she the mystery challenger who's going to throw her hat

421
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,500
的神秘挑战者吗?
into the ring to challenge POTUS in two years?

422
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,950
我们需要发消息称此圈内不允许丢帽子
We need to send the message that the ring is a hat-free zone.

423
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:21,650
不允许贝雷帽 不允许斯泰森毡帽(阔边高顶毡帽) 不允许小便帽
No berets, no Stetsons, no beanies...

424
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,610
你为什么要数帽子?
Why are you just listing hats?

425
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,960
Jonah是对的
Jonah's right.

426
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:28,220
我得去露露脸 我乱七八糟的脸
I've gotta put my face out there, my fucked-up face.

427
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,950
我感觉超好 这一觉我睡得很沉
I feel so good. I had such a deep sleep.

428
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,240
看上去我坐在这里就对了
Looks like I'll just be sitting over here being right.

429
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,990
哦 在和我们共事的700天里 你就对了一次
Yeah, in 700 days of working with us, you've been right once.

430
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,650
像个绅士一样坐着 可以吗?  哦 天哪
Sit like a gentleman, please?  Oh, my God.

431
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:41,150
你喜欢这个样子 Mike?
You like the view, Mike?

432
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,800
好吧 大家 副总统来了
Okay, everyone. The vice president.

433
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,680
副总统女士
Madam Vice President.

434
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,370
请给她些空间  你们好 你们好 伙计们
Please, give her some space.  Hi. Hi, guys.

435
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:48,990
很抱歉让你们久等了 我很好
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting. I'm fine.

436
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,800
我不希望你们认为我在隐瞒什么
I didn't want you to think I'm hiding anything.

437
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,190
因为那不是我的风格
'Cause that's not my style.

438
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,870
刚刚发生的就是我 呃...
What happened is that I, um...

439
00:18:56,890 --> 00:18:59,120
我撞破了一扇玻璃门
I walked through a glass door.

440
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,140
唯一被重伤的是我的自尊
And the only thing that's really hurt is my pride.

441
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,010
是不是有什么突发状况?
Were there any mitigating circumstances?

442
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,090
是不是有在铺地毯或者...?
Was there carpeting or...?

443
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,610
那有在铺地毯吗 Mike?  是的
Was there carpeting there, Mike?  Yes.

444
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,350
那有 是的 被证实了
There was. Yes, it has been confirmed

445
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,870
那里有在铺地毯
that there was carpeting there.

446
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,880
您会参加明天的"动起来长跑" 对吗?
You will be doing the Get Moving Run tomorrow, correct?

447
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:16,240
我一定会跑的 (竞选)
I fully intend to run.

448
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,910
哦 不
Oh, no,

449
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:21,420
这他妈真是爆老子的痔疮
that's a fucking wire brush to my hemorrhoids.

450
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:23,420
谢谢 女士
Thank you, ma'am.

451
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,520
她要么就是疯了
So she's either crazy

452
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,620
要么就是开始了她的总统竞选活动
or she's starting a presidential campaign.

453
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,350
哦 我会说那两个是同义词
Yeah, I'd say the two are synonymous.

454
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,680
"我要竞选"?  不 不 不
<i >  "I intend to run"? No, no, no.

455
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,370
她是在说跑那个比赛 先生 那个一万米
She was talking about running the race, sir, the 10K.

456
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:35,400
搞定它 否则我会让你的卵蛋和桌子"联络"一下
Fix it or I'll liaise your balls to your desk.

457
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,180
是的 先生 感谢您持续的...
Yes, sir. And thank you for your continued...

458
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,330
他挂了
he's gone.

459
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,950
Amy Amy Amy 好吧 Amy
Amy, Amy, Amy. Okay, Amy.

460
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,210
她明天得去跑步
She needs to run tomorrow

461
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,900
将所有总统选举的猜测变走 好吗?
to magic away any presidential speculation, okay?

462
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,920
她不能跑那个趣味跑
She can't do the Fun Run.

463
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,810
这个时候她几乎不能走几步
She can barely do a convincing walk at the moment.

464
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:50,440
好吧 能并且会  不能而且不会
Okay, can and will.  Can't and won't.

465
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,730
马上上去然后蹂躏一只枕头
Now go up and screw a pillow.

466
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:53,260
房间已经付过钱了  哦
The room's paid for.  Oh.

467

Come here.  What?

471
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:09,150
哦  搞什么啊?
Oh.  What the fuck?

472
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,780
你为什么笑?
Why are you laughing?

473
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,330
我喜欢卡通
I love cartoons.

474
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:14,870
天
Jesus.

475
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,360
那是你 Gary  闭嘴
That's you, Gary.  Shut up.

476
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,780
那个包一点都不像Leviathan
That doesn't even look like the Leviathan.

477
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,110
你还有什么消息?  外面还在说什么?
What else you got? Is there anything else out there?

478
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,260
您推迟与媒体的见面
Your delay in facing the press

479
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,350
引起了对您长期健康状况的猜测
has raised speculation on your long-term health.

480
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:26,900
什么?
What?

481
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,440
他们疑问您是否能胜任这份工作 女士
They're asking if you're up to the job, ma'am.

482
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,520
我是否胜任这份工作?
Am I up to the job?

483
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,670
哦 呀
Ooh, jeez.

484
00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:32,940
哦  腿的问题?
Ooh.  the leg thing?

485
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,020
嗯  是的
Yeah.  Yeah.

486
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,100
说真的 我的能力完全超越了这份工作好么
Seriously, I am totally overqualified for this job.

487
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,300
停止!  你知道...
Stop it!  You know...

488
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,850
停止什么?  没什么
Stop What?  Nothing.

489
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,970
这些花是国防部长Maddox
These flowers came for you

490
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,650
送给你的
from the Secretary of Defense Maddox.

Oh, let's see.

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,710
Good luck with your Fun Run.		祝你在趣味跑上好运

493
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:48,400
别在起跑枪声鸣起的时候骂脏话
Try not to swear when the starter pistol goes off.

494
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,730
别这样  他就是个曲张的老二静脉
Come on.  He's just a varicose dick vein.

495
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,300
我没法忍受那个男人 好了 走吧 伙计们
I can't stand that guy. All right, let's go, guys.

496
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,390
我去了一家墨西哥卡拉OK餐馆
I went to a Mexican karaoke restaurant

497
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,100
唱了首Lenard Cohen的《哈利路亚》
and I did "Hallelujah" by Leonard Cohen.

498
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,080
哦 不 不是吧
Oh, no, you didn't.

499
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,110
我有 我把"哈利路亚"
I did, and I changed the "hallelujah"

500
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,050
to "jalape駉. "
改成了"墨西哥小辣椒"

501
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:07,960
哦 哈 哈! 我可以想象那有多好玩 先生
Oh ho ho! I can imagine that was very funny, sir.

502
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,830
哦 天哪 是委员会
Oh, Christ. It's the Committee.

503
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:13,040
他们会对总统调查投票
They're gonna vote on the POTUS investigation.

504
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,290
哦 我想会没事的 先生
Yeah, I think that's gonna be fine, sir.

505
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,710
哦 你当然会那么想 Jonah
Yeah, of course you do, Jonah.

506
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,380
你不懂里面的复杂性
You don't get the complexity.

507
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,730
你是这世界上最大的单细胞生物
You're the world's biggest single-cell organism.

508
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,790
嘿 Amy 你知道国务院的Schmidt吗?
Hey, Amy, you know Schmidt at the State Department?

509
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,890
他是那个告密者 没错
He's the whistleblower. Yeah.

510
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,210
总统会陷入大麻烦
POTUS is gonna be up Shit Creek

511
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,900
而我不会在他周围给他当他妈的踏板
and I am not hanging around to be his fucking paddle.

512
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,770
我不会  不会变成那样的 女士
I'm not.  It's not coming to that, ma'am.

513
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,670
我们不知道 我只是说
We don't know. All I'm saying is that

514
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:36,560
会有很艰难的选择要做 你明白吗?
there are going to be difficult choices to make, you know?

515
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,840
就像《苏菲的抉择》那么难的选择 (著名电影)
Like "Sophie's Choice" choices,

516
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,340
除了它更重要  因为会和我有关
except more important because it's gonna be about me.

517
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,710
哦 嘿 大家好!
Well, hey there!

All right, ma'am.  Okay.

520
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,050
她的妆真的太浓了
She is definitely wearing too much makeup.

521
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,720
她看起来就像Marcel Marceau (默剧小丑 "毕普先生")
She looks like Marcel Marceau.

522
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,230
没错 他也不能分辨真玻璃和空气的区别
Yeah. He couldn't tell the difference between real glass and air either.

523
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,870
别这样 这他妈的很有趣
Come on, that's fuckin' funny.

524
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,530
各就各位预备...  等等
on your marks...  Wait.

525
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,500
哦  我害怕
Yeah.  I'm scared.

526
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,850
...预备 跑!  耶 好
<i> ... get set, go!  Yeah. Okay.</i>

527
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,400
哦 去  来吧!
Oh, shit.  Let's do it!

528
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,390
哦 我看到你了!
Yeah, I see you!

529
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,480
我看到你了
<i>I see you.</i>

530
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:18,110
一起动起来!
Let's get moving!

531
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,770
哦 天哪 我们有警告她
Oh, Christ. Did we warn her

532
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,450
其中一个动起来大使
one of the Get Moving ambassadors

533
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:23,040
是个只有一条腿的老兵吗?
was a one-legged veteran?

534
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,090
他就在她后面 她绝不会看到他
He's behind her. She's never gonna see him.

535
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,360
但等等 她那样打败一个一条腿的男人
But wait, does it look good...

536
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,150
看起来会好吗?
her beating a one-legged guy like that?

537
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,310
不 看起来不好
No, it doesn't look good.

538
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,170
另一个选择会更差 你不觉得吗?
The alternative is a little worse, don't you think?

539
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,980
关键是我们得让她看起来像是能打败那个男人
The key is we make it look like she could beat the guy,

540
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,270
但是她让他赢
but then she lets him win.

541
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,360
没错 用输换得的双赢 那不错
Yeah, a win-win by losing. That's good.

542
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,210
嗯?
Yeah?

543
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,240
喂?
Hello?

544
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,600
Gary 你得让她慢下来
Gary, you need to get her to slow down.

545
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,700
哦 谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

546
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,420
如果她打败那个残疾人看起来会很糟
It looks bad if she's beating the disabled guy.

547
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,380
好吧
<i>Okay.</i>

548
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,200
嘿 女士 女士
Hey, ma'am, ma'am.

549
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,090
您得慢下来  为什么?
You gotta slow down.  Why?

550
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,290
看起来不怎么好
It looks bad.

551
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,950
哦 天 什么? 我的脸
Oh, God, what? My face.

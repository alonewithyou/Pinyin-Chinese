1
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:21,616
<i>疑云笼罩在这届政府班子上<i>
<i>A cloud of suspicion hangs over this administration.</i>

2
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:24,786
有过掩饰吗？ 谎言？
Were there cover-ups? Lies?

3
00:00:24,853 --> 00:00:26,787
哦 天 我恨弹劾
Oh, God. I hate impeachments.

4
00:00:26,855 --> 00:00:28,156
太90年代范儿了
They're so '90s.

哦 总统现在被参议院
Well, the president now has the Senate

6
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:32,193
和众议院紧追不舍 祸不单行
and the House after him. Gonna rain pain.

7
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:34,662
总统的下一步行动是什么？
So what's POTUS's next move, Jonah?

00:00:34,696 --> 00:00:36,162
哦 我的嘴巴都封住了
Oh, these lips are on lockdown.

10
00:00:38,232 --> 00:00:40,366
不 我只是有个"不问不说"的原则
No, I just have a "don't ask don't tell" policy

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,834
对我知道的事情
about the things that I know.

12
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:43,168
或者我不知道的事情
Or that I don't know.

13
00:00:43,235 --> 00:00:45,937
Jonah 不要说话 别呆在这
Jonah, don't talk, don't stay.

14
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:47,938
你需要滚回你的西部世界 (西翼双关)
You need to fuck off and go back to Westworld.

15
00:00:47,972 --> 00:00:49,039
但是 女士 你得滚了
- But, ma'am-- - You need to fuck off.

16
00:00:49,073 --> 00:00:50,474
但是 女士 我说了滚

17
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,508
三次滚了 你出局了 是的 女士
- Three fucks, you're out. - Yes, ma'am.

Yeah. Uh, guys, everybody in my office, please.

19
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,616
呃 Gary 你为什么不过来坐到我身边？
Um, Gary, why don't you come sit here next to me?

20
00:01:00,683 --> 00:01:02,318
好的
Okay.

21
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:08,825
我已经跟Amy说过这个了
I've already told Amy this,

22
00:01:08,859 --> 00:01:11,528
但我有些事需要告诉你们所有人
but I have something that I need to tell you all.

23
00:01:11,562 --> 00:01:13,297
我想我知道你要说什么
I think I know what you're gonna say.

24
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,134
我已经决定不和总统联合参与
I've decided I'm not going to join POTUS

25
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:20,972
下一次竞选了 我要离开
in the next election. I'm gonna get out.

26
00:01:21,006 --> 00:01:22,540
哦
Yeah.

27
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:28,579
女士 向您致以我最深切 最深切的同情
Ma'am, you have my deepest, deepest sympathies.

28
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:31,314
好吧 呃 我还没死
Okay, well, I'm not dead.

29
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:34,317
我的计划是
My plan is

30
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,886
两年后我会离开
that I'm gonna leave in two years,

31
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:39,656
但我会竞选总统
but then I'm gonna run for president

32
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,258
在那四年后
four years after that.

33
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:45,028
但与此同时 很明显我无法留住每个人
But in the meantime, I obviously can't keep everybody on.

34
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,230
不 没什么
No, it's okay.

35
00:01:46,264 --> 00:01:49,667
所以如果你们需要寻找其他工作
So if you need to look for other jobs,

36
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,302
那么你们得开始思考了
then you need to be thinking about that.

37
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:53,271
现在没人在想那个 女士
No one's thinking about that right now, ma'am.

38
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:54,472
我们从未想过这件事
Furthest thing from our minds.

39
00:01:54,506 --> 00:01:56,074
我仍在消化这条消息
I'm still digesting the information.

40

你真的认为她会离开吗？
You really think she'll go?

50
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,597
天 那太遗憾了
God, that's such a shame.

51
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:22,667
不 那表示我完全没活干
No, it means I have absolutely nothing to do.

52
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,902
我刚才是为她遗憾
I meant for her.

53
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,370
一样 这大概表示
Still, this might mean

54
00:02:25,404 --> 00:02:28,173
我们可以有更多的时间在一起
that we could spend more time together.

55
00:02:28,207 --> 00:02:30,375
我们慢慢来
Let's take it one day at a time.

62
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,491

是的 先生 呃 我一直将您视为导师
Yes, sir. Well, I always thought of you as a mentor.

66
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:55,334
我爸爸的父亲形象太怪异也太遥远了
The father figure my own dad was too weird and distant to be.

67
00:02:55,369 --> 00:02:58,271
就像那晚你留宿 第二天早上我们一起看报纸的时候？
Like that night that you stayed over and we read the papers the next morning?

68
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:00,439

嘿 你动起来像什么 Will？

88
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,745
我就像密西西比警察
I move as slowly as a Mississippi detective

89
00:03:41,812 --> 00:03:43,813
侦查年轻黑人谋杀案一样慢 (种族歧视最臭名昭著的南方州之一)
investigating the murder of a young black man.

90
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,082

我希望我可以敲断他的脊柱
Wish I could break his spine.

但我不能 因为它是用果冻做的 (没骨气)
But I can't, 'cause it's made of Jell-O.

取而代之的 是跟我见面
And you're gonna meet with me instead.

104
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:18,148
女士 我之前正要跟您说这个
Ma'am, that is what I was going to tell you earlier today

105
00:04:18,183 --> 00:04:19,917
直到您对我说... 滚开
until you told me to-- - Fuck off.

106
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,687
您是在接完我的话还是再对我说一次那个？
Are you finishing my sentence or are you telling me that again?

107
00:04:22,755 --> 00:04:24,188
都是
Both.

108
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:25,890

00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,228
国会议员...
Congressman...

111
00:04:31,262 --> 00:04:33,464
喔 你很快
Wow, you're fast.

112
00:04:33,498 --> 00:04:35,899
只是想知道您是否需要一个顶级的媒体人
Just wondering if you could use a top press guy.

113
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:38,135
哈! 我真的一点都不需要你 Mike
Ha! I really don't have any need for you, Mike.

114
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,670
你有些过时了
You're kind of obsolete.

115
00:04:39,705 --> 00:04:41,906
你就像是困在过去的维京海盗
You're like a Viking stuck in time.

116
00:04:41,941 --> 00:04:45,077
我有很强的人脉 真的?
I have excellent contacts. - Really?

117
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:47,112
很高层的人 先生 非常高
Very high up people, sir. Very high up.

118
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,382
或许你能给我联络上Charlize Theron (奥斯卡影后)
Maybe you can hook me up with Charlize Theron.

119
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:50,750
很好笑 但我是认真的 先生
Funny, but I'm being serious, sir.

120
00:04:50,784 --> 00:04:53,286
不 我也是认真的 我想干她
No, I'm being serious, too. I'd like to fuck her.

121
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,223
不管怎样 你为什么要离开？ 你和你的老二都卡在副总统的无咖啡因咖啡里了？
Why'd you leave anyway? You get stuck with your dick in the veep's decaf?

122
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,692
不 我们只是都需要新的挑战
No, we just all need new challenges.

123
00:04:59,727 --> 00:05:01,428
我们？ 什么 整个小组都要离开？
We? What, is the whole team leaving?

124
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:03,196
不 不 不 先生 去他妈的
- No, no. No, sir. - Holy shit.

125
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,798
她要退选了 不 完全不是
- She's leaving the ticket. - No, absolutely not.

126
00:05:05,832 --> 00:05:08,434
我们他妈的有协议 我两年后当选参议员
We had a fucking deal. I make Senate in two years,

127
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:10,236
六年后我们一起参加大选
we run together as a team in six.

128
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:12,672
协议就是这样的 你他妈为什么不自杀 Will？
- That was the deal. - Why don't you fucking kill yourself, Will?

129
00:05:12,706 --> 00:05:15,608
让我澄清一下 先生 如果她要退选的话
Let me be clear, sir. She may be planning to run in six years

130
00:05:15,642 --> 00:05:17,109
那么她可能打算六年后参选
if she was leaving the ticket,

131
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:19,845
而我没有真的说她会
which I have not actually said she will.

132
00:05:19,879 --> 00:05:22,815
哦 我滴苍天 谢谢你停下来
Oh, fucking God, thank you for stopping.

133
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:24,584
你知道吗？ 如果我之前还不知道
You know what? If I didn't already know

134
00:05:24,618 --> 00:05:27,053
你工作做得有多烂 你刚刚也证明了这一点
how shitty you are at your job, you just proved it.

135
00:05:27,087 --> 00:05:30,090
我有些重大的消息 女士
I have some very big news, ma'am.

136
00:05:30,124 --> 00:05:31,992
哦 我有巨大的消息
Well, I have huge news.

137
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:35,728
事实上 我向你保证我的消息会是头版的那种
In fact, I guarantee you that my news is front-page news.

138
00:05:35,763 --> 00:05:38,297
而你的大概是第六页(娱乐版)
Your news is probably more like a page six,

139
00:05:38,332 --> 00:05:40,332
Kardashian的那种无聊消息 (娱乐家族卡戴珊)
Kardashian crap news.

140
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:42,835
总统知道这一切将如何结束
POTUS knows how this is all going to end,

141
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,205
所以他喝了我那一蓝色超大马克杯
so he drank the poisoned Kool-Aid

142
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,308
的毒Kool-Aid饮料
from my very big, blue mug.

143
00:05:48,342 --> 00:05:51,577
哈？ 两年后他不会竞选连任了
- Huh? - He isn't going to run again in two years.

144
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,116
你认真的？
Are you serious?

145
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,084
不 我是他妈的Joan Rivers(著名喜剧演员)
No, I'm Joan fucking Rivers.

146
00:05:58,119 --> 00:05:59,686
我当然是认真的
Of course I'm serious.

147
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,256
一旦党内领袖发现他不会参选
Once the party leadership figures out he's not gonna run,

148
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,226
那么所有弹劾狗屁都会烟消云散
then all the impeachment bullshit is just gonna fade away.

149
00:06:06,293 --> 00:06:07,827
那么 呃
So, um--

150
00:06:07,862 --> 00:06:10,731
那么为什么他不来对我说？ 为什么是你告诉我这个？
so why didn't he tell me this? Why are you telling me this?

151
00:06:10,765 --> 00:06:13,767
因为他没法忍受那表情 像那个
Because he couldn't stomach the look-- like that,

152
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:15,835
就像那个 控制不住的喜悦
just like that-- of unbridled joy.

153
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,871
Ben 我在心底
Ben, I am crying

154
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,674
默默地哭泣
very quietly on the inside.

155
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:23,343
而在你的脑海里 你正在他的墓上跳舞旋转
While in your mind you're doing pirouettes on his grave.

156
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:25,245
哦 别告诉我你没有为此高兴
Oh, don't tell me you're not happy about this.

157
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,646
你终于能摆脱这里了
You're finally getting out of here.

158
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,082
哦 不是工作让人沮丧
Well, it's not the job that's depressing.

159
00:06:29,116 --> 00:06:30,983
生活才让人沮丧
Life is depressing.

160
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,887
走吧
Let's go.

161
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:39,190
不 我可以 我能做到这个
No, I've got it. I can do this.

162
00:06:39,225 --> 00:06:41,559
我没事
I'm fine.

163
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:44,595
耶!
Yes!

164
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,097
操!  天哪!
Fuck! Gosh!

165
00:06:49,134 --> 00:06:50,868
Ahem.

166
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,204
你好 Sue
Hi, Sue.

167
00:06:54,238 --> 00:06:56,718
因为一些紧急事件 我们想见副总统
We'd like to see the vice president as a matter of some urgency.

168
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,675
不行 操你的 我从偏门进
- No. - Fuck this, I'm going in the side door.

169
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,377
你那么做的话 特勤局特工可能会拧断你的脖子
You do and Secret Service might break your neck.

170
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:03,047
那就悲剧了 是么？  女士
- That would be a tragedy. - Yeah? Ma'am.

171
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:04,548
哦 你好 Roger 我们能谈谈吗？
- Oh, hi, Roger. - Can we talk?

172
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:07,085
我们当然能谈谈 嘿 能请你给我酸奶吗？
Of course we can talk. Hey, could I have my yogurt, please?

173
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,220
哦 这 别吃得太快
Oh, here. Don't eat it too fast.

174
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:10,922
哦 住嘴 大惊小怪的家伙
Oh, stop it, Nervous Nelly.

175
00:07:10,956 --> 00:07:14,059
好了 给我来点流质的食品 加把勺子
All right, get me something sloppy with a spoon to eat.

176
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,594
你想来点酸奶吗？ 不 谢谢
- Do you want some yogurt? - No, thanks.

177
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:17,362
你看起来不错 顺便说 哦 谢谢
- You look good, by the way. - Oh, thanks.

178
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,717
什么 你在锻炼还是什么？
What, are you working out or what?

179
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,700
是的 我用老的焦虑疗法消耗卡路里
Yeah, I'm burning calories with the old anxiety diet.

180
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,302
哦 你知道的 焦虑(anxiet-ease精油)
- Oh. - You know, the anxiet.

181
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:25,971
如果你想做有氧运动 你得先有心才行啊
If you want to get some cardio exercise, you have to have a heart.

182
00:07:26,006 --> 00:07:27,740
我听说了一个很糟糕的谣言
I heard a pretty lousy rumor

183
00:07:27,775 --> 00:07:31,077
说你两年后不会再和总统一起竞选了
<i>that you're not running for reelection with POTUS in two years.</i>

184
00:07:31,111 --> 00:07:32,645
那很令人困扰 因为我有点需要
Oh. - And that would be disturbing

185
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,181
你再次以副总统的身份参选
because I kind of need you to run as VP again.

186
00:07:35,215 --> 00:07:36,749
然后我进入参议院
And then I get in the Senate

187
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:39,252
然后你和我一起参选
and then you and I run together as a team.

188
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:41,321
记住 这是协议 是的 我记得那个
- Remember, that was the deal. - Yeah, I remember that.

189
00:07:41,355 --> 00:07:42,722
你从哪听来的谣言？
Where did you hear this rumor?

190
00:07:42,757 --> 00:07:44,357
哦 从小姜饼那
Oh, I heard it from the Gingerhead Man.

191
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,359
有小胡子的裂缝(嘴) Mclintock(同名电影主角)
The gash with the stash. McLintock.

192
00:07:46,393 --> 00:07:47,860
什么 你在开玩笑？
What, are you kidding me?

193
00:07:47,895 --> 00:07:50,497
Mike视信息为敌 忘了它吧
Mike sees knowledge as the enemy. Forget about that.

194
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:54,301
那么你两年后会和总统一起竞选？
Then you are running with the president in two years?

195
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:57,204
两年后我绝对会参选
I am absolutely running in two years.

196
00:07:57,238 --> 00:08:00,307
那之后的四年 竞选连任 宝贝
And then four years after that, reelection, baby.

197
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:02,809
你说竞选连任是什么意思？
What do you mean reelection?

198
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:05,144
不是竞选连任 那个时候是竞选
Not reelection. Election at that time.

199
00:08:05,179 --> 00:08:06,980
是的 没错 你和我竞选
Yep. right. - you And I election.

200
00:08:07,014 --> 00:08:08,748
等等 但你刚刚为什么说竞选连任？
Wait. But why did you say reelection?

201
00:08:08,782 --> 00:08:10,416
什么? 你说了竞选连任
What? - you said reelection.

202
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:13,953
那就意味着有什么其他的事情发生了
Which implies that perhaps something else is going on.

203
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:15,488
我指的是参选 你知道我说的是什么
I meant election. You know what I meant.

204
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:17,656
但你说了竞选连任 我指的是参选 好吗？
- But you said reelection. - I meant election, okay?

205
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,358
这就像说i易燃的和容易燃烧的
It's like saying flammable or inflammable.

206
00:08:20,393 --> 00:08:23,228
都是一样的意思 我闻到了有猫腻的味道
- It's the same thing. - I smell a fucking rat.

207
00:08:23,262 --> 00:08:25,363
哦 闭嘴 我也告诉你那是什么意思
- Oh, stop it. - I'll tell you what it is, too.

208
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,998
那就是这整个政府班子
It's this whole administration.

209
00:08:27,032 --> 00:08:28,733
我会在这整个东西下面点把火
And I'm gonna light a fire under the whole thing.

210
00:08:28,768 --> 00:08:31,569
然后我们就会找出是易燃的还是容易燃烧的了
Then we'll find out whether it's flammable or inflammable.

211
00:08:31,604 --> 00:08:34,405
走 小器的基佬 走了
<i>Come on, Wilbo Faggins,</i> <i>let's go.</i>

212
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:38,076
好吧 我亲爱的副总统班子在哪？

但如果你需要我的话我就在这
But I shall be right here if you need me.

220
00:08:57,564 --> 00:08:59,931
就像是象征着....的大橡树... 女士
Like the mighty oak that stands for-- ma'am.

221
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:04,336
我有话要说
I have something to say.

222

- That's awesome. - I did not see that coming.

228
00:09:20,253 --> 00:09:23,823
Selina Meyer 她点燃了他们 砰!
Selina Meyer, she deals 'em fire. Bam!

229
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,458
砰! 我们这是要上天了!
Boom! Let's go to the fucking moon!

230

好吧 我不是背包的兔子
Okay, I'm not a bag bunny.

她不爱你 好吗？ 她不在乎
She doesn't love you, okay? She doesn't care.

312
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:45,126
她真的在乎 你就是个给她工作的人
- She does care. - You're just a guy that does a job for her.

313
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,161
那不是事实 谁对你而言更重要？
- That's not true. - Who's more important to you?

314
00:12:47,229 --> 00:12:50,264
我还是她？ 好吧 那个选择 没法
- Me or her? - Okay, that choice, there's no way--

315
00:12:50,298 --> 00:12:51,619
我们有什么是有黑松露的？
Do we have any with black truffle?

316
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:53,800
那是F15 好吗？

00:12:53,835 --> 00:12:56,503
听着 你让我在你和她之间选择 这是不可能的
Listen, the choice you're giving me between you and her, that's impossible.

抱歉 没有黑松露 我说的是白松露
Sorry, not black truffle. I meant white truffle.

Amy, this is really happening.

332
00:13:25,531 --> 00:13:27,932
你知道 听着 别去管早些时候的我
You know, listen, just ignore that earlier me.

333
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,467
那个狗屁的"大草原上的小房子"
The "Little House on the Prairie" bullshit.

334
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:32,237
不 更新的我 全部精神集中在事业上

00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,374
当然 我就在你身后/身旁
Of course, and I am right behind/beside you.

337
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:38,910
你 总统的办公厅主任
You, Chief of Staff to the president,

338
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:42,380
而我...主管性感和侧抱
me, chief of sexiness and spooning.

339
00:13:42,415 --> 00:13:45,283
没错 但就像我说的 现在的重心
Yeah, but as I said, the focus right now

340
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,851
必须是...
has got to be...

341
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:50,055
嘿 Amy 我能和你谈谈吗？
Hey, Amy, can I talk to you about something?

342
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,157
突发的大囧事
Accidental dick move.

343
00:13:52,192 --> 00:13:55,428
我写Selina在科技展览上的讲话写得太快
I had to write Selina's speech for the science fair so fast

344
00:13:55,462 --> 00:13:59,199
导致我觉得我抄了我给Chung准备的谈话
that I think I plagiarized a speech that I wrote for Chung.

345
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,268
这是Selina的文本
So here's Selina's hard copy

346
00:14:01,302 --> 00:14:03,837
而Chung的已经上传到他的YouTube上了
and Chung's is already up on his YouTube.

347
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:06,773
我遇到了个叫Juanita的年轻姑娘
I met a young woman name Juanita.

348
00:14:06,808 --> 00:14:10,077
哦 就是这段 这和美国对我而言是什么无关
- Oh, here's the bit. - It's not about what America means to me.

349
00:14:10,111 --> 00:14:12,412
而是我对美国来说意味着什么
<i>It's what I mean to America.</i>

350
00:14:12,447 --> 00:14:15,582
因为没有了美国人民美国就什么都不是
<i>Because America would be</i> <i>nothing without Americans.</i>

351
00:14:15,617 --> 00:14:17,418
天 你写了这段屁话？
Jesus, you wrote this shit?

352
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:19,820
是的 这就像一碗没有动词的汤
Yeah, it's like a noun-verb gumbo.

353
00:14:19,854 --> 00:14:21,822
这就是个虚拟的女孩 我给了她同一个女孩
So it's the fictitious girl. I gave her the same girl.

354
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:24,358
尽管我把Juanita换成了Anita
Although I did change it from Juanita to Anita.

355
00:14:24,392 --> 00:14:26,126
哦 那是个绝妙的计划
Oh, that's a brilliant plan.

356
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,162
你为什么不把美国换成蒙羞美国(shame+美国)？ 哦 我现在打给Mike
Why don't you change America to Shmamerica? Yeah, I'm calling Mike.

357
00:14:28,196 --> 00:14:30,664
不用 我已经试过了 直接转到了他的语音信箱
No, I already tried him. It went straight to voice mail.

358
00:14:30,698 --> 00:14:34,768
我遇见了这个叫Anita的年轻科学家
I met this young scientist named Anita.

359
00:14:34,803 --> 00:14:36,870
我对她说... 你有充电器吗？
And I said to her... - you got a charger?

360
00:14:36,905 --> 00:14:39,139
嘘 我正在观看 好吧 赢家
- Shh, I'm trying to watch. - Okay, champ.

361
00:14:39,173 --> 00:14:41,442
...她说 "不是科学对我而言是什么
...and she said, "It's not what science means to me,

362
00:14:41,476 --> 00:14:44,411
而是我对科学意味着什么"
it's what I mean to science."

363
00:14:44,446 --> 00:14:47,514
让我们先做这个 这是个可以地图定位宠物的社交媒体网络
Let's do this one first. This is a mappable social media cloud for pets.

364
00:14:47,549 --> 00:14:49,483
哦 我被那个惊艳了 全垒打
- Oh, I'm impressed with that. - Home run.

365
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,285
听着 我告诉你 三个词:
Listen, let me tell you something. Three words--

366
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:53,020
党团 初选 钱
caucus, primary, money.

367
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:54,221

Right? - Go big.

368
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:56,690
不 四个词 还是钱 对吧？
No, four words-- money again. Right?

369
00:14:56,725 --> 00:14:58,826
因为那就是我们需要的 Mike 我们需要很多钱
'Cause that's what we need. Mike, we need a lot of money.

这里的是Rachel和Erica 女士
This is Rachel and Erica over here, ma'am.

371
00:15:01,029 --> 00:15:02,830
哦 哇哦 这是什么？ 它是个蚂蚁公社
- Oh, wow, what is this? - It's an ant kibbutz.

372
00:15:02,864 --> 00:15:05,066
好吧 我想要看看那个
Okay. I would love to look at that.

373
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,701
哦 我刚刚有个想法
Oh, and I just had a thought.

374
00:15:06,735 --> 00:15:09,204
记得那个爱荷华煎牛排的东西？ 唔嗯
Remember that Iowa steak fry thing? - Mm-hmm.

375
00:15:09,238 --> 00:15:10,505
我们得去那个 是的
We need to Go to that. - Yeah.

376
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,007
真的 因为那里有很多钱
Seriously, 'cause there's a lot of money there.

377
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:14,776
还有牛排 还有牛排 我爱那个
And steak. - And steak. I love it.

378
00:15:14,811 --> 00:15:17,012
我知道你在想什么 副总统女士
So, I know what you're thinking, Madam Vice President.

379
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,348
你确定？ 哦 哦 有限的空间 对吧？
- You do? Uh-oh. - A confined space, right?

380
00:15:19,382 --> 00:15:20,716
但这是个人文环境
But it's a humane environment.

381
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:23,118
哦 从上面看 他们看起来像蚂蚁
Well, from up here, they look like ants.

382
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:25,888
那是个笑话
That's a joke.

383
00:15:25,922 --> 00:15:27,957
因为它们就是蚂蚁 这边请 女士
- Because they are ants. - This way, ma'am.

384
00:15:27,991 --> 00:15:30,859
这是某种机器人 真的吗？ 就那样？
- This is some kind of robot. - Really? That's it?

385
00:15:30,894 --> 00:15:33,929
我能走开一下吗？ 嘿 慢货Joe
- Would you excuse me? - Hey, Joe fucking Slow.

386
00:15:33,964 --> 00:15:35,998
你有想到过要接电话吗？
You ever think about answering your phone?

387
00:15:36,033 --> 00:15:38,701
冷静 我弄丢了我的充电器 你有吗？
Chill out. I lost my charger. You got one?

388
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,505
你在科技展览上 随便一个孩子就能给你做一个充电器
You're at a science fair. One of these kids could build you a charger.

389
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:44,141
怎么了？ Ben一整天都在试图联络副总统
- What's the problem? - Ben's been trying to get in touch with the veep all day.

390
00:15:44,175 --> 00:15:45,209
好吧 呃 她很忙
All right, well, she's busy.

391
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:46,777
抱歉 Todd 很快
Sorry there, Todd. Just real quick.

392
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,512
哦 国家事务
Oh. - Matters of state.

393
00:15:48,546 --> 00:15:50,815
先生 没错 副总统在这 是Ben
Sir, yes, I have the vice president for you. It's Ben.

394
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,117
给她点空间 你好 Ben 怎么样？
- Give her a little space. - Hi, Ben. How's it going?

395
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,920
Furlong在城里到处说
Furlong has been spraying all over town

396
00:15:55,954 --> 00:15:59,056
你认为总统会退出
that you think POTUS is gonna quit.

397
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:03,327
什么？ 我没对那个暴躁的蠢货说过任何事
What? I didn't say anything to that crusty ass clown.

398
00:16:03,361 --> 00:16:05,262
我大概搞混了几个词 但是...
I might have mixed up a couple words, but...

399
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,831
好吧 现在总统没法说他不会为连任竞选
Well, now POTUS can't say that he won't be running for reelection

400
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:09,933
因为那会让他看起来像是被迫出局的
<i>because it'll look like</i> <i>he's being pushed out.</i>

401
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:11,435
所以现在我们懦弱的
So now our spineless,

402
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:14,004
反复无常的蠢货会留下来
flip-floppy fuckbag is staying.

403
00:16:14,038 --> 00:16:16,673
哦 去 一切正常吗？
- Oh, boy. - Is everything okay?

404
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,643
我得在我点燃这里的某个书呆子之前出去
I've got to get out of here before I set fire to one of these nerds.

405
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:21,318
好吧 好吧 走 那是我的手机
- Okay, okay, let's go. - That's my phone.

406
00:16:21,346 --> 00:16:23,581
谢谢 谢谢 副总统女士
Thank you. Thank you. - Madam Vice President.

407
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,384
不 我们很抱歉 她真的很喜欢它
- No. - We're so sorry. She really likes it,

408
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:28,118
但不幸的是她没有时间了 伙计们
but unfortunately she's out of time, you guys.

409
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,088
但这里的这个男人会代替她
But this man right here is gonna take over for her.

410
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:34,525
别搞砸这个了 这会是场即将发生的公关噩梦
Don't fuck this up. This is a public relations nightmare waiting to happen.

411
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,295
什么事都答应他们 谢谢 孩子们
Promise them everything. Thank you, kids.

412
00:16:44,736 --> 00:16:47,004
女士 你...
Ma'am, are you--

413
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,819
我想你会喜欢这里
<i>I thought you'd like this spot.</i>

414
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,723
现在特区秘密会面的必来之地
DC's current go-to place for these off-the-record meets.

415
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:07,892
好选择 就像我们过去常在部队里说"雷达侦测不到"
Good choice. Under the radar as we used to say in the military.

416
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:09,895
嗯 我想其他人也会这么说
Yeah, I think other people say that, too.

417
00:17:09,929 --> 00:17:12,364
这和对真相的忠诚有关
It's about loyalty to the truth.

418
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,298
以及对美国人民的忠诚
And to the American people.

419
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,968
Furlong和Doyle将枪口指向了总统
Furlong and Doyle have turned their guns on the president.

420
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,370
这是最糟糕的一种友军炮火
That's the worst kind of friendly fire.

421
00:17:19,405 --> 00:17:21,105
就是不友好的那种
The unfriendly kind.

422
00:17:21,139 --> 00:17:23,007
是的 哦 Danny 我只是想让你知道
Yeah, oh, Danny, I just want to let you know,

423
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,176
你其中一件轶事可能意外地
one of your anecdotes may have accidentally

424
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,111
被我写进了副总统的讲话
made its way into a veep speech via me.

425
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:29,280
如果你能让这件事过去 我会很感激
And I'd really appreciate it if you could let this one slide.

426
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,850
Selina是个剽窃者？ 太完美了
Selina's a plagiarist? That's perfect.

427
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,485
你刚给了我一颗银子弹(杀暗黑生物的绝招)
You just handed me a silver bullet.

428
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,020
而如你所知 我是个好枪手
And as you know, I'm a good shot.

429
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:38,823
尽管 我大概不会叫她撒谎者
I might back away, though, from calling her a liar.

430
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:41,459
毕竟 你没有真的碰到过 一个叫Juanita并说过那些话的人
After all, you didn't really meet anyone named Juanita who said that.

431
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,095
不 我 有 就像我记得的那样 是这样的...
No, I did. As I recall, it went something like...

432
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,365
Ching先生 我来美国工作 (Chung模仿的是华人口音 而Juanita是拉丁裔名)
Mr. Ching, I come to America to work.

433
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:50,469
我把钱寄回去 但这里的生活对我来说很艰苦
I send money home, but life here is so hard for me.

434
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,637
我不知道你还会配音
I didn't know you did voices.

435
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:57,942
Sue 过来
Sue, come here.

436
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:00,545
Dan在哪？ 他出去了
- Where's Dan? - He stepped out.

437
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,113
Um, ahem.

438
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:06,784
总统决定他要留下来
POTUS has decided that he is staying,

439
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:10,488
他到底还是要寻求连任
and he is going to seek reelection after all.

440
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,156
他当然想留下来
Of course he wants to stay.

441
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,493
你能不能不...
Could you just not...

442
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,027
他要连任
So he's running for a second term,

443
00:18:17,062 --> 00:18:19,363
就是说我不会为首任任期竞选
which means I won't be running for a first term.

444
00:18:19,397 --> 00:18:22,332
那么我没有任何理由留下来 我会离开
So there's no point in my staying. I'm just gonna leave.

445
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:25,602
他又改主意了？ 是的
- So he changed his mind again? - <i>Yeah.</i>

446
00:18:25,636 --> 00:18:27,937
天 他的脑袋里面绝对就像Escher的画 (以"迷惑的图画"出名)
Jesus, the inside of his head must be like an Escher drawing.

447
00:18:27,972 --> 00:18:30,039
女士 Andrew来见您了
<i>Ma'am, Andrew is here to see you.</i>

448
00:18:30,074 --> 00:18:32,442
哦 好 更多的伤害和失望
Oh, good, more hurt and disappointment.

449
00:18:32,476 --> 00:18:34,510
有另外一件事
There is one other thing that--

450
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:37,013
我很抱歉让您失望
and I'm so sorry to let you down,

451
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,983
但是我会留在Selina那里
but I'm gonna stay with Selina.

452
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:43,320
你觉得你能决定
You think you get to decide

453
00:18:43,354 --> 00:18:45,055
我是不是要雇用你？
on whether or not I hire you?

454
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,058
外面有大把的Dan Dan
There are plenty of Dans out there, Dan.

455
00:18:48,093 --> 00:18:50,728
看看周围
Look around.

456
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,564
抱歉 孩子
Sorry, kid.

457
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:54,967
嘿 别叫我孩子 好吗？
Hey, don't call me kid, okay?

458
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:57,202
我是说 第一 你不是Jimmy Cagney (银幕硬汉) 好吗？
I mean, A: you're not Jimmy Cagney, all right?

459
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:59,371
第二 我们基本上他妈的同龄
And B: we're practically the same fucking age.

460
00:18:59,405 --> 00:19:01,940
那么知道我比你取得了多得多的成就你肯定很伤心
Then it must really hurt to know how much more I've achieved in life.

461
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,609
满是功勋的老兵 未来的总统
Decorated veteran. President-in-waiting.

462
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:07,111
哦 好吧 你看到这个了吗？ 看到这里的这个了吗？
Oh, okay. Do you see this? See this right here?

463
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:10,181
你知道这个是什么吗？ 这是我在世界上最大的大提琴上演奏"操你丫"
You know what this is? This is me playing "Fuck You" on the world's biggest cello.

464
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:12,716
哦 我想某个人刚刚自杀性的毁灭了他自己的未来
Oh, I think someone just suicide bombed their own future.

465
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,220
天 你知道 如果你每次提及 那场该死的战争的时候就给我一美元的话
God, you know, if I had a dollar for every time you mentioned that goddamn war,

466
00:19:16,254 --> 00:19:18,522
我的钱足够买个坦克 然后把你他妈的大肥头给轰下来
I would buy a tank and I would blow your fat fucking head off.

467
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:21,192
喔 好吧 抱歉 Dan
Wow. Well, I'm sorry, Dan.

468
00:19:21,226 --> 00:19:24,862

I hate to leave a man down, but I'll see you around.

469
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:27,998

你让我过来 却空手而归？

你现在真的要这么对我说话？
Are you really talking to me like this right now?

现在没人会雇我们了
no one's gonna hire us now.

585

找只信号枪 塞到你口里 然后把头爆了
Take a flare gun, put it in your mouth, and blow your head off.

你是副总统的秘书
<i>You're the secretary</i> <i>to the vice president.</i>

593
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,341
那就像Garfunkel(歌手)的巡回乐队管理员 好吗？
That's like being Garfunkel's roadie, okay?

594
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,877
所以这是Selina的队伍在行动啊
So this is Selina's team in action.

好吧 伙计们 我们不想太提前
Okay, guys, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves here.

612
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:01,600
我们有很多事情要做 是的 前方是条漫长的路
- We've got a lot of work. - Yep, a long road ahead.

613

当然 没错
<i>- Of course.</i> - Yeah.

617
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,878
总统 他知道形势变得很严峻
POTUS, he knew the gig was up

618
00:25:12,946 --> 00:25:15,680
因为Doyle Furlong Chung...
because Doyle, Furlong, Chung

619
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,482
全部让党内反对他
all turned the party against him.

620
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,985
我是说 那就是 安息吧总统

- We'll see. - Ma'am, I am so psyched.

628
00:25:40,774 --> 00:25:42,935
科技展览的讲话是抄了Chung的
And the science fair speech was plagiarized from Chung.

629
00:25:42,943 --> 00:25:44,477
只是希望提前让您知道
Just wanted you to know that up front.

630

那么开始了 是的 让人蛋疼的一击
- And so it begins. - Yeah, with a kick to the tits.

633
00:25:51,518 --> 00:25:54,487
那么 Dan 你自己搞出来的烂摊子你自己收拾
So, Dan, you're gonna have to clean up your own shitty diaper.

634
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:56,556
明白吗？ 没问题
- <i>Got it?</i> - Not a problem.

635
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,025
哦 等等 你知道吗？ 我们得谈谈竞选活动了 不是吗？

Gary 打电话给Dana 她打过来了90次
Gary, call Dana. She's called 90 times.

638
00:26:03,197 --> 00:26:05,465
去 跟她谈 然后让她安静
<i>- Shit.</i> - Talk to her, then sedate her.

639
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,335
女士 总统已经离开这栋大楼了
Ma'am, the president has left the building.

640
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,471
他妈的谁关心？
Who gives a flying fuck?

641
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:14,674
还没有 抱歉 我很抱歉 但我控制不住
- Not yet. - Sorry. I'm sorry, but I couldn't help it.

642
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,009
女士 西翼
Ma'am, West Wing.

643
00:26:17,044 --> 00:26:19,112
这是你的错 不 不
- This is your fault. - No, no.

644
00:26:19,146 --> 00:26:22,048
我到得不够早 以至于我没法切除这个肿瘤
I didn't arrive soon enough to be able to cut out the cancer.

645
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:25,552
哦 不 我认为你是带着充满肿瘤的卵袋来的
Oh, no, I think you arrived with a man bag filled with tumors.

646
00:26:25,586 --> 00:26:27,687
那是总统的问题
That was POTUS's problem.

647
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:30,223
因为他依靠着那两个人
Because he relied on those two guys.

648
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:33,126
一个是精疲力尽的失败者 另一个是装瞎的机器人
One a burnt-out loser, the other a conniving robot.

649
00:26:33,161 --> 00:26:35,462
疯狂 糟糕的组合 没错
- Crazy. - Bad combo, yeah.

650
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:39,399
哦 你们好 孩子们 请进
- Oh, hello, kids. - Come on in.

651
00:26:39,434 --> 00:26:42,169
哦 天 你们一直都在这？
Oh, my God, have you been here this whole time?

652
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:44,171
M&M (巧克力糖) 给科学家们
M&Ms for the scientists.

653
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:45,839
跟我一起来 因为我有个好主意
So come with me 'cause I've got an idea.

654
00:26:45,873 --> 00:26:47,641
我大概会带你们逛逛西翼
I might show you around the West Wing.

655
00:26:47,675 --> 00:26:49,676
啊! 真的？
- Ahh! - Would you?

656
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:51,444
你们喜欢政府吗？ 是的
do you Like government? - Yes.

657
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:53,279
你们喜欢政治吗？ 是的
And do you Like politics? - Yeah.

658
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,849
哦 好 因为政治就是和人有关 你们不这么认为吗？
Oh, good. Because politics is about people, don't you think?

659
00:26:55,883 --> 00:26:57,884
没错 它是 当你思考的时候
Yeah. - It is when you think about it.

660
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,620
因为没有人 就不可能有政治
<i>'Cause without people,</i> <i>you can't have politics.</i>

661
00:27:00,655 --> 00:27:02,122
看这多热闹？
See how crowded this is?

662
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,924
我是说 这很容易引起幽闭恐怖症
I mean, it's very claustrophobic.

663
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:07,695
我想总统应该只让她的人员在这
I think that the president should only have her staff here.

664
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,764
或者他的员工 你知道 他们的
Or his staff. You know, their staff.

665
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,959
我是说 我从没见过 就像我们刚刚经过的那个
I mean, I've never seen-- like that one we just passed,

666
00:27:11,968 --> 00:27:13,068
我不知道那是谁
I don't know who that person is.

667
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:14,436
在我的生命中我就没见过那个人
I've never seen that person in my life.

668
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,670
在这不知道干嘛
No business being here.

669
00:27:15,705 --> 00:27:19,007
Selina没有抄袭Danny Chung的讲话
Selina did not plagiarize Danny Chung's speech.

670
00:27:19,042 --> 00:27:20,743
Mike已经告诉你那个了
Mike's already told you that.

671
00:27:20,777 --> 00:27:22,311
不 我没有抄袭Mike
No, I am not plagiarizing Mike.

672
00:27:22,345 --> 00:27:25,014
我知道这很无聊 但是 嘿 我就是很无聊
I know it's boring, but, hey, I'm boring.

673
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:28,150
那些窗帘...要拆掉
Those curtains there are going.

674
00:27:28,185 --> 00:27:30,219
天哪 真是丑
Wow, those are hideous.

675
00:27:30,253 --> 00:27:33,389
我们还是在一起的 对吧？ Ed 我没时间
- We're still together, right? - Ed, I haven't got time.

676
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:36,126
我们的时间还是指一般意义上的时间？
Time for us or do you mean time as a general concept?

677
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,662
你好 Terry 抱歉我错过了你的电话
Hi, Terry. I am sorry I missed your call.

678
00:27:38,696 --> 00:27:42,233
你好 Dana 嘿 嘿 听着
Hi, Dana. Hey. Hey, listen.

679
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,968
我只是想说
I just wanted to say that--

680
00:27:44,002 --> 00:27:46,637
好吧 好吧 如果你有什么要说 你先
Okay. Okay. If you've got something to say, you go first.

681
00:27:46,672 --> 00:27:49,874
当她说"哦 天 哦 天"的时候 你妈妈有在抄袭圣经吗？
Was your mom plagiarizing the Bible when she said, "Oh, God, oh, God"?

682
00:27:49,909 --> 00:27:52,945
总统的椅子
The president's chair is a couple inches higher

683
00:27:52,979 --> 00:27:55,114
比总统办公室的其他椅子都要高几英寸
than the rest of the chairs in the Oval Office.

684
00:27:55,148 --> 00:27:57,516
我以前常常想 "哦 天 那太可笑了"
And I used to think, "Oh, my God, that's so ridiculous."

685
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,851
但现在我觉得这很有意义
But now I think it makes sense

686
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:00,765
因为我认为这是个不错的心理暗示
because I think it's a good psychological trick.

687
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:03,789
是的 那就是我... 你还没说完？ 继续
Yeah, that's what I-- you're not finished? Go ahead.

688
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:06,625
哦 她喜欢那些奶酪
Oh, she loved the cheese.

689
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:08,460
很喜欢
Loved it.

690
00:28:08,495 --> 00:28:11,164
当我长大的时候 我想像您一样成为副总统
When I grow up, I want to be vice president just like you.

691
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:13,800
哦 不 你不会 你会想成为总统的
Oh, no, you don't. You want to be president.

因为你来上班了他们才装的这个吧 Gary
They only put those in after you started working here, right, Gary?

绿色产业稳操胜券 这很好

对 你是唇膏帝 Gary

你对我说的每一句都不友善

127
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:27,687

你在更远的轨道
You are distantly orbiting her.

134
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,471

你要知道 你刚好站在射击范围内
Because, you know, you're gonna be right in the line of fire.

138
00:05:55,649 --> 00:05:58,284
那不是我的工作 如果她倒下了 我会帮她
It's not my job. I would help her if she was down.

139
00:05:58,285 --> 00:06:00,353
对 如果她的嘴被枪击了 你会上唇膏
Right, with the lip balm if she got shot in the lips.

140
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:01,688
那可以重创敌人
That could crack 'em pretty bad.

听到这个真高兴
That is great to hear.

245
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,058
如果你能拿到参议院改良法案
If you can get a Senate reform bill

246
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:33,227
就代表它的确需要改

253
00:10:47,474 --> 00:10:49,675
我需要你让那些石油产业
Well, I need you to keep oil guys

254
00:10:49,676 --> 00:10:52,879
离绿色产业小组远点
off the clean jobs task force.

255
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,449
不要这样 Andrew  我就是要这样 对
- Don't do this to me, Andrew. - I'm going to do it to you, yup.

256
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:58,452
这是个微妙的区域
This is a nuanced area.

257
00:10:58,453 --> 00:11:00,320
你跟石油产业不是一边的吗
You are not in the pocket of oil?

258
00:11:00,321 --> 00:11:02,623
不是 我们不是一边的
No, I'm not in the pocket of oil. No.

259
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:04,259
我们可以做到的
So we can make this work.

260
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,661
我很想做点实事  对
- I'm eager to be constructive. - Right.

261
00:11:06,662 --> 00:11:10,164
看起来好像我做得到 那么我...
It seems to me that somehow we can make this happen, then I'd...

262
00:11:10,165 --> 00:11:13,033
成交 你让石油产业远离绿色产业
Deal. You keep oil guys off clean jobs,

263
00:11:13,034 --> 00:11:14,935
我就会支持法案
I will sponsor the filibuster bill.

264
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:17,237
我们可以做…
Well, we can work...

00:11:17,238 --> 00:11:18,939

269
00:11:26,547 --> 00:11:29,549
Gary Doyle参议员的幕僚就像要死了一样
Gary, senator Doyle's guy looks like he's dying.

270
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,051
如果我是你 我就会上药房 把所有药都买一份
If I were you, I would go straight to the pharmacy and take one of everything.

271
00:11:32,052 --> 00:11:34,548
在去药房的路上我就爆发了
I'm gonna have a blowout if I walk to the pharmacy.

272
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,565
这是我担心的
That's what I'm worried about.

273
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:36,989
如果你要拉在裤子上 就不要坐在这
If you're gonna shit your pants, I don't want you here.

274
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,225
嘿  我觉得自己做对了
- Hey. - I think I did the right thing,

275
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:42,495
但还是要你确认一下
but I just need you to confirm that I did the right thing.

276
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,163
我对某人说了某事
I said something to someone.

277
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:47,200
你具体说了什么 女士 对谁说的
What exactly did you say, ma'am, and to who?

278
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:48,802
对谁
To whom.

279
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:51,338
Doyle参议员说他会支持法案...
Senator Doyle said that he would sponsor the bill...

280
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:52,907
Oh!

281
00:11:52,908 --> 00:11:55,610
如果我们让石油产业远离绿色产业的话
If we keep oil off of clean jobs.

282
00:11:55,611 --> 00:11:58,680
这里有个暗示 也许...
And there was an implication, perhaps...

283
00:12:00,516 --> 00:12:03,152
你没说好吧  没
- You didn't say yes? - No.

284
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:05,321
我没说 好
I didn't say yes.

285
00:12:05,322 --> 00:12:07,556
我说的是 嗯
I said yeah.

286
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:10,626
是这样 我们对石油产业说可以让他们插一脚
Okay, well, we told oil we'd put one of their guys on clean jobs.

287
00:12:10,627 --> 00:12:12,240
所以我们才能在那条餐具围脖上全身而退
That's why we got away with the cutlery tweet.

288
00:12:12,241 --> 00:12:12,794
我知道 知道
I know, I know.

289
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,396
她知道  我只是被Doyle迷住了
- She's aware of that. - Okay, I was charmed by Doyle.

290
00:12:15,397 --> 00:12:17,065
他眼睛在闪烁
He's got that little twinkle in his eye.

291
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:18,900
他说到给人家一拳
He was talking about fisting people.

292
00:12:18,901 --> 00:12:22,136
他对我很好 我很开心
He just niced me. I got niced.

293
00:12:22,137 --> 00:12:24,004
你当时在哪 Amy
And where were you, Amy, by the way?

294
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,872
不 你说你能搞定
No, you said you had it covered.

295
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:27,975
没有 我搞不定 而且你的工作就是
No, I didn't have it covered. And it's your job to know

296
00:12:27,976 --> 00:12:30,811
在我说能搞定的时候看出来我搞不定 并且帮我搞定
that if I say I have it covered, I don't have it covered and you cover me.

297
00:12:30,812 --> 00:12:34,748
我需要你们帮我收回那些话
I need you all to make me have not said that.

298
00:12:34,749 --> 00:12:37,618
我要你们...帮我撤回那些话
I need you to have... make me unsaid it.

299
00:12:37,619 --> 00:12:39,153
我们先慢慢理一下
Let's just slow down for a second.

300
00:12:39,154 --> 00:12:41,622
做两栏 一个冗长辩论 一个绿色产业
Make two columns, one with filibuster, one with clean jobs,

301
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:43,791
因为它们现在是相对的
because now they are versus.

302
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,360
Doyle在冗长辩论上帮我们 把他放那儿
Doyle gives us filibuster, so put him there.

303
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:49,396
好 但是石油业能帮绿色产业
Okay, but oil gives us clean jobs.

304
00:12:49,397 --> 00:12:51,031
绿色产业是你的主力  是的
clean jobs is your legacy. - Yes.

305
00:12:51,032 --> 00:12:52,766
等等  干嘛
- Hold on a second. - What?

306
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:57,403
我们能不能把一个曾经是石油业的人 放进绿色小组
What if we put an ex-oil guy on the task force?

307
00:12:57,404 --> 00:12:59,015
懂我意思吗
You see what I'm saying?

308
00:12:59,016 --> 00:13:00,306
一个以前做石油的 不是很石油的
Someone who's cozy with oil, but not active oil.

309
00:13:00,307 --> 00:13:03,008
前石油业  那是撒谎
- Former oil. - That's lying.

310
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:05,611
创意语义学
Creative semantics.

311
00:13:05,612 --> 00:13:08,347
创意的语义来表达我们在撒谎
Well, that's a creatively semantic way of saying we're lying.

312
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:09,782
那也是创意
Still creative.

313
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,485
哦 嘿Jonah Jonah Jonah
Oh, hey, Jonah. Jonah. Jonah.

314
00:13:12,486 --> 00:13:14,588
我们... 我们在...
That we... yeah, that we might like.

315
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:17,258
我要说的是 我们先跟随我刚说的
What I'm saying is that we go with what I just said,

316
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,660
那个 呃 那个...
the, um, the...

317
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:21,830
牙买加朗姆酒口味
Jamaican rum flavor.

318
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,667
这个选择真心重口味
That's a really strong flavor choice.

319
00:13:25,668 --> 00:13:27,468
我是说 很意外
I mean, it's unexpected,

320
00:13:27,469 --> 00:13:29,404
很古怪 有点性意义
it's funky, it's kind of sexual.

321
00:13:29,405 --> 00:13:32,674
对 我也不想太快做决定
Yeah, I don't want to make too quick of a decision.

322
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:35,450
考虑下其他口味吧
Let's consider other flavors.

323
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:40,060
比如香草味  拜托 女孩子才吃香草
- Like vanilla. - Oh, c'mon. Vanilla is a girl's flavor.

324
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:42,082
不 我没选择 Amy
No, I have no choice here, Amy.

325
00:13:42,083 --> 00:13:44,417
因为我被逼到墙角了
Because I was backed into a corner.

326
00:13:44,418 --> 00:13:47,420
所以其他口味对我来说都不算选择 知道吧
So other flavors aren't an option for me, okay?

327
00:13:47,421 --> 00:13:49,790
也许 如果你们工作做好些
Perhaps if you had done your job better,

328
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,360
那我还能选选香草或者巧克力味
then, oh, I could choose vanilla or chocolate

329
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,596
或者他妈的蓝莓味 上面还有他妈的小屑屑
or fucking blueberry with fucking sprinkles on it.

330
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:56,464
但那都不是我的选择 好吗
But that's not an option for me, okay?

331
00:13:56,465 --> 00:13:58,467
那个口味构不成选择  好
- That flavor's not an option for me. - Okay.

332
00:13:58,468 --> 00:14:00,403
其实我觉得牙买加朗姆味也不错
You know, I think Jamaican rum is a great choice.

333
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,505
你的热情会对它有帮助的
And your passion about it is gonna sell it.

334
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,774
我混乱了 我们还是在说酸乳酪对吧
I'm confused. Are we still talking about yoghurt here?

335
00:14:04,775 --> 00:14:08,145
我们就照Dan的意思做  好
- We're gonna go with Dan's idea. - Okay.

336
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:11,047
选牙买加朗姆酒口味
Jamaican rum is where we are headed.

337
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:13,617
知道吗 牙买加朗姆酒哇  好
- All right? Jamaican rum, mon. - Okay.

338
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,519
不错
That's good.

339
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,987
其实可以不要那个口音
Maybe we don't need the accent.

340
00:14:16,988 --> 00:14:18,922
嘿 Dan  嗯?
- Hey, Dan. - Yeah?

341
00:14:18,923 --> 00:14:21,459
Leon West现在在楼下前台等你
Leon West is down at front security for you.

342
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,627
Leon West? Leon West来这儿找你?
Leon West? Leon West is here for you?

343
00:14:23,628 --> 00:14:25,462
那个记者? 那个专门跟咱们对着干的记者?
The journalist? The beltway butcher?

344
00:14:25,463 --> 00:14:27,998
不用担心 好吗?
Don't you worry for one second, all right?

345
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:29,567
我要带他去酸乳酪店喝一杯  我一点也不担心
- I'm gonna take him to the yoghurt store. - I'm not worried.

346
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,736
因为你要甩了他 干掉他
Because you are gonna get rid of him. You're gonna kill him

347
00:14:31,737 --> 00:14:35,006
再因谋杀终身监禁 我就再也不用见到你这张脸了
and you're gonna do life for murder and I never have to see your face again.

348
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:38,511
我要再这么勤洗手
You know, if I wash my hands anymore,

349
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:39,912
骨头都得冒出来了
the bones are gonna come through.

350
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,648
Dan跑哪儿去了
Hey, where is Dan?

351
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,683
他现在在酸乳酪店呢
He's at the yoghurt store.

352
00:14:43,684 --> 00:14:46,086
Gary你还好吧 是不是病了
Gary, are you all right? Are you getting the bug?

353
00:14:46,087 --> 00:14:48,622
不是 我...
No, I'm... oh!

354
00:14:48,623 --> 00:14:51,557
情况有点不妙  怎么了
- Okay, you're not gonna like this. - What?

355
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,693
刚跟白宫发言人联系上了
White House press guys have just been in touch.

356
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,095
Postus想下星期从非洲回来以后
Postus wants to announce clean jobs task force

357
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,997
再宣布绿色产业小组的事
next week when he is back from Africa.

358
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,878
现在我们再次欣赏一下愤怒的副总统
We now go over live to the Vice President for her pissed-off reaction.

359
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:05,600
不是吧 他想下个星期再宣布
Come on. He wants to announce it next week.

360
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,738
对  好吧 这本来是我出的政策
- Yeah. - Okay, it's my policy.

361
00:15:07,739 --> 00:15:11,242
他想掺和进来  天晓得 对 他的确是想掺一脚
- He's sliding in. - Who knows? Yeah, that feels like a slide.

362
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,478
每次都这样 不是吗  是
- This happens every time, does it not? - Yes.

363
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,847
就像Charlie Brown踢那个橄榄球(踢空)  对啊
- It's like Charlie Brown and the football. - Yeah.

364
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,616
我们又得从头做起
We're gonna have to rewind this, okay?

365
00:15:17,617 --> 00:15:19,852
因为我已经让Dan去做背景调查了
Because I've got Dan backgrounding it right now.

366
00:15:19,853 --> 00:15:22,555
啥 你让Dan去做那个  没错
- What? You asked Dan to do that? - Yeah, I did.

367
00:15:22,556 --> 00:15:25,292
我让他去全是因为这个 副总统点二的事
I asked him because of the whole veep point two thing.

368
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:27,795
两点论
Two point me.

369
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:29,863
这个两点论 的事情
The two point me thing.

370
00:15:29,864 --> 00:15:32,032
马上打给他让他别出声
Now you have to call him and tell him to stay quiet.

371
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:35,302
然后赶快去那个酸乳酪店
And you've got to go down to that yoghurt store.

372
00:15:35,303 --> 00:15:37,504
你刚刚是不是对我翻白眼了
You didn't just roll your eyes, did you?

373
00:15:37,505 --> 00:15:39,606
没 老大  看着就像朝我翻白眼了
- No, ma'am. - 'Cause it sure looked like it to me.

374
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,107
我受不了那种消极反抗的态度
I can't stand that passive-aggressive stuff.

375
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:44,844
今天都变成世界末日了
This whole day is turning apocalyptic now.

376
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:46,511
好好干 行不？
Okay?

377
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:47,779
遵命
Okay.

378
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,415
Leon 嗨
Leon, hi.

379
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:53,418
就在这里  行 Dan 你又不肯说干嘛要见我
- Just right in here. - Okay, Dan, a very obscure rendezvous.

380
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:55,386
所以要么你的消息够新鲜
So you either have a very hot story for me,

381
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,588
要么你就是来一枪崩了我的
or you're going to shoot me.

382
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:59,423
我这儿有个消息给你
I have got a story for you.

383
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:01,391
事情马上就要变得副总统口味了
Things are about to get very veep-tastic.

384
00:16:01,392 --> 00:16:04,260
Egan先生 很高兴见到你
Mr. Egan. good to See you. - Anthony.

我们都很兴奋等着副总统今天大驾光临
We are very excited about the Vice President's visit today.

387
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,138

- Oh, as are we. - My son has named a yoghurt after her.

388

草莓味的Selina 可好喝了
Strawberry-Selina. It's very tasty.

389
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:15,607
这名真好  这位是谁

您好 我是《华盛顿邮报》的Leon West
Leon West, ma'am. Washington Post.

391

Oh, we don't get the Post.

392
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:22,848
这是一个家族经营的老店
This is an old, established family store.

393
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:27,086
我们拼写的酸乳酪(yoghurt)中间是有个H的
And we spell yoghurt with an H right there in the middle.

394
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,488
我看到了 会记下的
I see that. I'll make a note of it.

395
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:30,456
嘿 Dan 你都不接电话呢
Oh, hey, Dan. You haven't been picking up your phone.

396
00:16:30,457 --> 00:16:32,792
是啊 我有点儿忙 Mike
Yeah, I've been a little bit busy, Mike.

397

你好呀 Leon  嗨 Mike

00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:39,197
还有他可爱的母亲Maria.
And his lovely mother Maria.

400
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:40,531
你这衬衫都被汗给湿透了
You have on a very sweaty shirt.

401
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,534
还真是的
By golly, I do.

402
00:16:43,535 --> 00:16:46,137
她直言不讳 她今年84了
She speaks her mind. She's 84.

403
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,940
不 女士您看着就像39岁
No. I had you pegged for 39, ma'am.

404
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:51,009
Mike可会说实话了
Mike is so good with facts.

405
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,746
我们俩都非常支持这届政府
We are both very big supporters of this administration.

406
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,448
非常感谢
We appreciate that. Thank you.

407
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,484
不过这可不容易啊
Although it's not always easy.

408
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,786
我们要交不少税啊
A lot of taxes you guys impose.

409
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:02,688
苛捐杂税  先别忙录
a ton of taxes. - Hold on a second.

410
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:05,058
苛捐杂税都要把我们生吞活剥了
Those taxes are eating us alive.

411
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,493
一口一口的  这个不是正式的...
- Gobble, gobble. - This isn't officially...

412
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,361
我们能不能先谈一下
If you'd excuse us for one moment.

413
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,763
Dan 能跟你单独说几句吗  一下就好
- Dan, can I talk to you for a second? - Just one second.

414
00:17:10,764 --> 00:17:13,966
半路杀出个Potus 我是这么看的 就这么说
Potus Interruptus, that's what I call it. And I'm gonna tell him.

415
00:17:13,967 --> 00:17:16,235
副总统女士 您不能进去参加会议
Madam Vice President, you can't go back in there for future meetings.

416
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:18,704
什么 不 老娘告诉你
What? No. Let me tell you something.

417
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,740
你跟那个傻逼总统说...
You tell that shit- for-brains President...

418
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:24,042
副总统女士 您能不能听我说一句
Madam Vice President, if you would listen to me for just one moment.

419
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,844
不 我一句也不想听
No, I won't listen to you for one second.

420
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,246
我一点都不想知道...  麻烦您闭嘴好吗
- I'm not interested in... - Please, be quiet!

421
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,550
总统现在胸很痛
The President is experiencing severe chest pains.

422
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,018
我们刚收到南非那边的消息
We just got word from South Africa.

423
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:35,188
您必须马上去白宫西厢
You need to get to the west wing immediately.

424
00:17:35,189 --> 00:17:38,024

你有没有看见
Did you see that caption

2
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:23,158
我在轩尼诗募捐会那张照片下的标题
underneath the photo of me from the Hennessy fundraiser?

3
00:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,226
谁是真正的第一夫人 就是性别歧视
Who's the real first lady? Sexist bullshit.

4
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,594
不要跟他们计较
Can't get drawn into it.

5
00:00:26,662 --> 00:00:29,197
比较了我们的服装预算和设计师...
Comparing our clothing budgets and our stylists...

6
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,565
好像我们只注重这些一样
Like that's all we care about?

7
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,436
还有那个叫Mark Rivera的 居然在专栏说我是天后
And that Mark Rivera called me a diva in his column.

8
00:00:34,503 --> 00:00:36,371
那个蠢侏儒
Stupid fucking midget.

9
00:00:36,405 --> 00:00:38,373
显然他没听你唱过
Clearly he hasn't heard you sing.

10
00:00:38,407 --> 00:00:39,774
他是个混蛋
The guy's a dick.

11
00:00:39,842 --> 00:00:41,676
嘿 Gary 帮我选好狗没
Gary, did you find me a dog yet?

12
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:43,778
好了 这里有几个候选
Yeah, I selected a few candidates.

13
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,580
或者我该说候选狗?
Or should I say canine-didates?

14
00:00:45,614 --> 00:00:47,048
不 你不用那么说
No, you shouldn't say that.

15
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,683
我看看  这个怎么样
Let me see. - What do you think of that?

16
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:50,185
梗犬? 对啊
a terrier? - Yeah.

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,721
不行 梗犬是天后狗 排除
No way. A terrier is a diva dog. Forget it.

18
00:00:53,756 --> 00:00:57,125
我才不要那种吵吵嚷嚷的小毛球 每30分钟还要拉一次屎
I don't need a ball of yappy hair shitting its body weight every 30 minutes.

19
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:58,860
那你想要猫吗 我可以帮你找只猫
Do you want a cat? I can get you a cat.

20
00:00:58,928 --> 00:01:00,995
不 不 我觉得自己是个坏妈妈 知道吗
No, no. I feel like a bad mom, you know?

21
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,731
Catherine小的时候我从不让她养狗
'Cause I never let Catherine get a dog when she was little.

22
00:01:03,766 --> 00:01:05,300
这是我们的新起点
This is a fresh start for us.

23
00:01:05,334 --> 00:01:06,801
从零开始做父母
It's parental ground zero.

24
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:10,672
瞧瞧这个
Look at this.

25

你们都不吃菠萝的吧
I didn't think you guys would eat the pineapple.

28
00:01:15,678 --> 00:01:17,112
听着 你养了狗 对不对
Listen, you're a dog person, right?

29
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,514
养的什么品种  我养了只真的狗
What kind of dog do you have? - I have a real dog.

30
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,483
Simon 黑色拉布拉多
Simon, black labrador.

31
00:01:21,517 --> 00:01:23,852
Simon? 真是个难以置信的名字
Simon? What an unbelievable name.

32
00:01:23,886 --> 00:01:26,087
我觉得他看起来就像个Simon
I guess he just looked like a Simon.

33
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:27,388
继续 拿照片出来看看 Mike
Go on, get the photo out, Mike.

34
00:01:27,423 --> 00:01:29,057
不要看照片吧
I don't think we need to see the photo.

35
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,525
噢 我想看照片
I'd love to see a photo.

36
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:32,360
好吧  我看看
Sure. - Let me see.

37
00:01:32,394 --> 00:01:33,517
皮毛真亮 是不是
Such a shiny coat, no?

38
00:01:33,518 --> 00:01:35,864
怎么保养的 Mike
How do you get that coat so shiny, Mike?

39
00:01:35,898 --> 00:01:38,333
呃 用水 很多水
Keep him hydrated. Lots of water.

40
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,569
知道吧  是喝还是拿来洗澡
you know? - to drink or applied directly to The coat?

41
00:01:41,637 --> 00:01:43,505
哈 离老子的假狗远点
Leave my fake dog alone.

42
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,973
我刚在想
You know, I was just thinking,

43
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:47,308
我们可以养搜救犬 效果不错的
maybe we should get a rescue dog 'cause it'll play great.

44
00:01:47,343 --> 00:01:50,545
只要不是三只脚再加个轮子的就行
As long as it's not one of those animals with three legs and a wheel.

45
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,947
好  四只脚 可以 三只脚 不行
- Yeah. - Four legs good, three legs bad.

46
00:01:52,982 --> 00:01:56,251
知道了  干啥呢 90年代末都这样打招呼
- I got it. - Whassup, as they say in the late '90s?

47
00:01:56,318 --> 00:01:59,120
嘿 Jonah 总统有没有取消中国总理的日程
Hey, Jonah. Did the President cancel the Chinese premier

48
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:01,356
他会来我的二十周年庆么 不 女士
- to come to my 20th party? - No, ma'am.

49
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,291
他肯定不会错过您的聚会
Although I'm sure he wouldn't miss it for the world

50
00:02:03,325 --> 00:02:06,194
如果不是因为他对世界举足轻重
if it weren't for the fact that he runs the world.

51
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:09,464
肯定的是 就算他出席了 也缓解不了您和第一夫人间的不和
I'm sure his absence has nothing to do with your rift with the first lady.

52
00:02:09,498 --> 00:02:13,201
什么 我们没有不和
What? There is no rift.

53
00:02:13,235 --> 00:02:15,036
只是一个小小 小小的分歧
It was one tiny, little disagreement

54
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,338
每个人都搞得像是打了架一样
and everyone's making it out like we had a catfight

55
00:02:17,373 --> 00:02:19,073
我们在地图室
in the map room or something.

56
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,442
话说 她打架会很凶狠
She'd be a rough fighter, though.

57
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,444
她肩膀超宽的 且不是因为垫肩
She's got big shoulders. Those aren't pads.

58
00:02:22,478 --> 00:02:24,679
噢 女士 总统想确认下 你什么时候会宣布
Ma'am, potus also wanted to know when you would be announcing

59
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:27,081
石油产业人员进绿色产业工作小组的事
the oil guy that's gonna be going on the clean jobs task force.

60
00:02:27,116 --> 00:02:30,218
Mike大哥在跟进  今天会吗 还是明天
- This bozo Mike's on it. - So today? Tomorrow?

61
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,954
听得懂就眨个眼 Mike  哈哈
Blink if you understand me, Mike....

62
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:35,290
至于那个不和谣言嘛 我会时刻竖起耳朵
And as regards to the rift rumors, I'll keep my ear to the ground for you.

63
00:02:35,324 --> 00:02:37,759
小心耳朵别掉了
Be careful your ears don't pop on the way down.

64
00:02:37,793 --> 00:02:39,227
好了 大家现在能进来吗
Okay, can everybody come in here, please?

65
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,795
可以  来吧
Sure. - come on.

66
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:42,530
我们要堵住谣言
Right, we're gonna have to shut down this story

67
00:02:42,565 --> 00:02:44,065
关于我和第一夫人不和
about me and the first lady.

68
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:46,201
所以 这个庆典不能太以我为中心
I mean, it means we're gonna have to undiva my party.

69
00:02:46,235 --> 00:02:48,670
也就是说 我的那些大照片不能摆出来了
We're gonna have to lose those huge photos of me.

70
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,405
不 我喜欢那些照片  我知道 都照得很好
- No, I like those. - I know, they're great photos.

71
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:52,240
我知道 但是我们不能要
I know, but there's no way we can have them.

72
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,382
这主意不错 我们不想你看起来像...
It's a good idea. We don't want you to look like...

73
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:54,909
斯大林
Stalin.

74
00:02:54,944 --> 00:02:56,578
我其实想说贝隆夫人
I was gonna say Eva Peron.

75
00:02:56,612 --> 00:02:59,080
对 这个比喻好点 没胡子
Yeah, I prefer that comparison. Less of a mustache.

76
00:02:59,115 --> 00:03:01,116
实际怎样知道吗 她挺时髦的
And you know what, actually? She was kind of chic.

77
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,118
怎一个美字了得  嗯 长得像麦当娜
Gorgeous. - Mmhmm. looks Like Madonna.

78
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:04,786
是的
Yeah.

79
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,889
Mike 任命Chuck的报道出来了吗
Mike, have you announced Chuck yet?

80
00:03:07,923 --> 00:03:09,858
我还在做 Amy  噢 拜托
- I'm still working on it, Amy. - Come on.

81
00:03:09,892 --> 00:03:11,993
这又不是胡佛水坝  这就是胡佛水坝…
- This is not the Hoover dam. - Yeah, it is the Hoover dam...

82
00:03:12,061 --> 00:03:13,228
豆腐渣工程
Filled with shit.

83
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:15,196
一旦任命那个Chuck Furnham 前石油产业人员
And when we announce Chuck Furnham, an ex-oil guy,

84
00:03:15,231 --> 00:03:16,664
进入绿色产业小组工作
on the clean jobs task force,

85
00:03:16,665 --> 00:03:18,833
知道随后会发生什么吗 Amy
do you know what happens with all that shit, Amy?

86
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,470
呃 会习惯你既不恰当又不愉快的比喻么
Does it get used in a clumsy and unpleasant analogy by you?

87
00:03:22,505 --> 00:03:25,206
Amy 石油业本来就不喜欢我 我们堵住了税收漏洞
Look, Amy, oil already hates me 'cause we're closing their tax loopholes

88
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:28,109
让他们为绿色产业买单 现在我是众矢之的
and making them pay for cleanup, so now I'm eating everyone's shit.

89
00:03:28,144 --> 00:03:30,478
我就像是人体蜈蚣里面 排最后的那个人
I'm like the last guy in a human centipede with this.

90
00:03:30,513 --> 00:03:32,013
不恰当比喻又来了
And there it is.

91
00:03:32,014 --> 00:03:34,282
我们只要放一个人进小组
We just got to put one guy on clean jobs.

92
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:36,117
Chuck是石油业的 但他不是坏的那种
Chuck's oily, but he's not evil oily.

93
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:38,820
他是前石油业  对 你今天要发出来
- He's ex-oil. - Yeah, you put it out today.

94
00:03:38,854 --> 00:03:42,190
今天? 半个哥伦比亚特区都在出席 Reeves参议员的剪彩仪式
Today? Half of D.C. is at Senator Reeves' dedication ceremony.

95
00:03:42,258 --> 00:03:44,259
那就在那儿发布
Well, then you put it out there.

96
00:03:44,293 --> 00:03:46,194
虽然这样很失礼 不过你是对的
I thought it might be disrespectful, but you're right.

97
00:03:46,195 --> 00:03:49,430
他是Rapey Reeves 那家伙什么时候有礼了
He was rapey Reeves. When was that guy ever respectful?

98
00:03:49,465 --> 00:03:53,401
好 您女儿两小时内会到
Okay, your daughter gets here in two hours.

99
00:03:53,435 --> 00:03:55,203

103
00:04:01,377 --> 00:04:03,411
噢 我不...  能查查吗

And just so you know, this is also what would happen if we were in a lifeboat.

107
00:04:11,887 --> 00:04:13,521
你不会信的
You're not gonna believe this.

108

Selina就在明年的飓风单上
Selina is on next year's list of hurricanes.

00:04:17,293 --> 00:04:19,093
万一它登陆了 出个头条说
What if it hits and we get headlines

111
00:04:19,128 --> 00:04:21,629
Selina造成大规模破坏 怎么办
saying Selina causing large-scale devastation?

112
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:24,299
人们不会把您跟自然灾害归类的 女士
People won't equate you with a natural disaster, ma'am.

113
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,401
真的吗 Amy 因为我遇到一些人
Really, Amy? 'Cause I've met some people, okay?

Reeves参议员娱乐中心

你知道那笨手笨脚老爷爷根本不能游泳吗
Did you know old grandpa fumblepants couldn't even swim?

119
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:45,286
他只能在浅水区看着别人
He would just hang out in the shallow end and stare.

120
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:47,555
你知道他最喜欢哪里中风吗
You know what his favorite stroke was?

121
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:50,091
难道是鸡鸡  就是鸡鸡

耳垂...就在那里

00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,310
最近好吗  对 先生 很好 先生
- You are well? - Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

144
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:44,612
噢 娘的 这蘑菇真好吃
Holy shit. These mushrooms are amazing.

145
00:05:44,647 --> 00:05:47,148
你想说什么 Mike  肯定加了意大利奶酪什么的
- What is it, Mike? - Must be ricotta or something in there.

146
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,950
哦 真好笑  对啊
- That's funny. - Yeah.

147
00:05:48,984 --> 00:05:50,485
真好 我喜欢幽默  对
- Goody, I love humor. - Yeah.

148
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,821
我这儿有个假设  嗯
I have a hypothetical for you. - Okay.

149
00:05:52,888 --> 00:05:56,291
如果我们让Chuck Furnham 加入绿色产业小组 您觉得怎样
What would you say if we announced Chuck Furnham to the clean jobs task force?

150
00:05:56,325 --> 00:05:58,293
Furnham?  对 Chuck
- Furnham? - Yeah, Chuck.

151
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:01,095
那就算副总统背叛了我们
Well, that would be a betrayal from the veep.

152
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,664
不一定吧
Not necessarily.

153
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:05,400
那我应该会把猿粪和蝙蝠屎混在一起
So I imagine that I would mix ape shit with bat shit,

154
00:06:05,434 --> 00:06:07,168
用怨念举起它
raise it to a whole new level of fury,

155
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,037
然后撕了你的脸
then I'd probably rip your face off

156
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:13,274
拿你的眼窝做性玩具
and use your eye sockets as a sex toy.

157
00:06:13,309 --> 00:06:15,677
就是个假设 跟你的一样
It's just a hypothetical like yours.

158
00:06:15,711 --> 00:06:17,312
Chuck就是打了石油的标签而已
Chuck would just be token oil.

159
00:06:17,346 --> 00:06:19,080
石油业以为他是特洛伊木马
Oil would think he's their trojan horse,

160
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:20,648
其实他是个空心马
he'd be a hollow horse.

161
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,684
也不算空心马 他还是特洛伊木马
Not a hollow horse. That's a trojan horse.

162
00:06:22,718 --> 00:06:25,019
但是个特洛伊空心马 先生
He'd be a hollow trojan horse, sir.

163
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,455
你们承诺过不会有石油业的人
I was promised no one from oil.

164
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,458
Chuck不是石油业的 他去年退休了  对 从石油业退的
- Chuck's not oil. He retired a year ago. - Yeah, from oil.

165
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:33,328
现在 我他妈一定要去跟副总统聊聊  好吧
Now I fucking want to speak to The Vice President. - Okay.

166
00:06:33,362 --> 00:06:35,830
飓风预告效果不错
Hurricane forecast is looking good,

167
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:37,999
您女儿刚刚也到达办公室了
and your daughter's just arrived at the office.

168
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:40,502
太好了 这是我们的暗号  Hallowes 飓风Hallowes
- Great, that's our cue. - Hallowes, hurricane Hallowes.

169
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:43,805
嗨 你好  Barbara 你好
Hi. Hello. - Barbara. Hello.

170
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,807
不好意思 Hallowes参议员
I am so sorry, Senator Hallowes.

171
00:06:45,841 --> 00:06:47,842
总统打电话来了  噢 亲爱的 对不起
- The President is calling. - Oh dear. I'm sorry.

172
00:06:47,877 --> 00:06:49,310
等我一下哦
Excuse me just for one second.

173
00:06:49,345 --> 00:06:51,179
听着 在你打假电话的时候
Listen, while you take your fake phone call,

174
00:06:51,213 --> 00:06:52,981
我应该可以把Dan偷来一下吧
is it okay if I steal Dan for a second?

175
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,749
或者说是偷回来?
Or should I say steal Dan back?

176
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,217
您能等一下吗
Could you hold on just one second?

177
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:58,386
知道吗 事实上 这个电话不是假的
You know what? Actually, this phone call is not fake.

178
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,389
Dan是个自由个体 他想去哪就去哪
And Dan is his own man. He can go wherever he wants.

179
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,025
好的 这边请Dan  让你等久了 总统先生
- Okay. This way, Dan. - I'm sorry to keep you holding, Mr. President.

180
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:06,152
知道什么是天后吗 那个才他妈是天后
You know who's a fucking diva? That's a fucking diva.

181
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:06,694
就是她
That one.

182
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,165
大学生活怎么样  挺好的
- So how's college? - It's good.

183
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:13,201
除开特勤处保卫人员什么的 我觉得自己...
You know, except for the whole secret service detail, I think I'm actually...

184
00:07:13,235 --> 00:07:15,303
副总统办公室  开始融入进去了
- Office of the Vice President. - ...Starting to blend in.

185
00:07:15,337 --> 00:07:17,405
不是 午餐时间当然是吃午饭
No, at lunchtime she eats lunch.

186
00:07:17,406 --> 00:07:21,042
再见  选好新狗了吗
Good-bye. Have you chosen a new dog yet?

187
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:22,710
什么狗
What dog?

188
00:07:22,745 --> 00:07:26,080
你妈妈要养狗 如果这还是秘密 我道歉
Your mom is getting a dog. Apologies if that was a secret.

189
00:07:26,081 --> 00:07:28,016
副总统办公室
Office of the Vice President.

190
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,853
你发短信甩了我女儿 连个道歉都没
You dumped my daughter by text and didn't even apologize.

191
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:35,523
没 我道了 我打了个苦脸表情
No, I did. I signed off with colon open brackets.

192
00:07:35,558 --> 00:07:38,993
听着 Selina真准备用Chuck Furnham 来安抚石油业游说团吗
Listen, is Selina really trying to appease the oil lobby with Chuck Furnham?

193
00:07:39,028 --> 00:07:41,296
我猜Chuck可以看做是一种手势 -
I suppose Chuck could be viewed as a gesture.

194
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,264
Chuck就是这种手势
Chuck is a gesture all right.

195
00:07:43,332 --> 00:07:45,433
知道石油业怎么叫他的吗
Do you know what these oil wise guys call him?

196
00:07:45,434 --> 00:07:48,369
叫他 谁他妈是Chuck Furnham
They call him who the fuck is Chuck Furnham?

197
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:50,405
Chuck Furnham本来是12:15来的 但是他12:00就到了
Chuck Furnham's at 12:15. Now he's at 12:00.

198
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:51,072
现在他在这儿
Now he's here.

199
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:54,275
副总统女士  Chuck 你好吗
Madam Vice President. - Chuck!How are you?

I've been thinking ever since I saw them,

207
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:12,460
你的孙子 Marion和… Richard.
your grandchildren, Marion and... - Richard.

208
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:16,197
对 Richard 我这儿有副总统牌m&ms豆 (巧克力豆)
Yes, Richard. And I have some vice presidential M&Ms

209
00:08:16,198 --> 00:08:18,099
想送给他们
that I would love for them to have.

210
00:08:18,134 --> 00:08:20,335
看到这个印章了吗 我们这还要一盒
You see the seal right there? Except we'll need another one

211
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,170
有两个孙子呢
because there are two grandchildren.

212
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:23,772

太感谢你了   不用谢
- Thank you so much. - You're so welcome.

216
00:08:30,613 --> 00:08:32,680
醒醒吧 Dan 这是石油业
Wake up, Dan. This is oil.

217
00:08:32,715 --> 00:08:34,716
你一旦任命Chuck Furnham
You nominate Chuck Furnham, and these guys

218
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,751
他们就会拿把铲子铲掉他的头
will fucking take his head off with a shovel.

219
00:08:36,786 --> 00:08:38,553

Your husband was a massive player.

224
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,597

Politically speaking, of course.

00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,166
我叫Jonah
I'm Jonah.

226
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,335
我在白宫工作...  你还好吧 女士
- I work at the White House. - Are you okay, ma'am?

227
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,337
噢 对不起 我都没意识到 你还好吧

你能帮我拿杯水来吗
Could you please get me a glass of water?

229
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:01,276
可是 这里没服务员啊 至少我没看见
You know what? There aren't any waiters, at least that I've seen.

230
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:04,279
Jonah 你能帮她拿杯水来吗

当然 当然了
Absolutely. Of course. Of course.

232
00:09:06,382 --> 00:09:08,183
我以为脱水了就没眼泪了
I guess all those tears must be dehydrating.

233
00:09:08,217 --> 00:09:09,717
我不这么觉得
I don't think it works like that.

234
00:09:09,752 --> 00:09:11,719
我还是去拿水吧 好吗
You know, I'll just get the water, okay?

235
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:14,656
你他妈的寡妇
Cock-blocking widow.

236
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,491
Doyle参议员否定了Chuck
Senator Doyle went black swan over Chuck.

237
00:09:16,525 --> 00:09:18,293
他说我们承诺过不要石油业的
He says we promised him no oil.

238
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:21,296
我对Chuck说任命今天会下来
I implied to Chuck that we would announce today.

239
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,765
该死 他有可能老得不记得了么
Shit. Is he senile enough to forget?

240
00:09:23,799 --> 00:09:25,200

等等 什么
Wait, what?

243
00:09:27,804 --> 00:09:29,938
对 她还预言了石油业所有的激烈反应
Yeah, she's predicting all kinds of backlash from oil.

244
00:09:29,972 --> 00:09:32,273
为什么石油业会不喜欢Chuck Furnham
How could oil not like Chuck Furnham?

245
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,342
因为他还不够油  噢
He's not oily enough....

246
00:09:34,376 --> 00:09:36,811
没关联的 一切我们喜欢他的理由 他们都讨厌
Unconnected. For all the reasons that we loved him, they hate him.

247
00:09:36,846 --> 00:09:41,716
所以我们现在同时有两个两难抉择了
Okay, so now we have two catch-22 situations simultaneously.

248
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,451
不会还有专门说这种情况的词吧
Is there even a name for that?

249
00:09:43,486 --> 00:09:45,353
四难抉择怎么样
- How about catch-44? - Gary.

250
00:09:45,387 --> 00:09:47,856
好吧 我去找石油业说客聊聊
Okay, I'm gonna run it by an oil lobbyist.

251

Sidney Purcell就在那儿  噢 真好

00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:55,063
大部分庆典照片都要拿走
Well, most of the party photos need to be removed.

254
00:09:55,097 --> 00:09:56,865
我不知道 用你的直觉
I don't know. Use your instincts

260
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:09,077
其实 你不用招待我的
You know, you don't have to entertain me.

261
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:11,546
我一个人发呆也挺好  噢 感谢上帝
- I'm cool with my own thoughts. - Oh, thank God.

262
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,282
电邮太多了 感觉心跳一下就来一封
'Cause I'm getting emails like every other heartbeat.

263
00:10:14,316 --> 00:10:15,583

绿色产业 对 那到底怎么回事
Clean jobs, yeah. What's going on there?

268
00:10:23,826 --> 00:10:26,361
你们还没定好人吗 还是担心
You guys got a name yet? You too afraid

269
00:10:26,395 --> 00:10:28,997
打印新闻稿会浪费地球资源
of wrecking the earth's resources to print up a press release?

270
00:10:28,998 --> 00:10:30,965
我刚准备告诉你
I was actually gonna run a name by you.

271
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,462
别说Chuck Furnham
Don't say Chuck Furnham.

272
00:10:33,463 --> 00:10:34,769
不准说Chuck Furnham

He's not oil. He's a fucking fossil, but he's not oil.

278
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,318
我们要能拿来堵枪眼的人
We need somebody who is plugged in.

279
00:10:50,352 --> 00:10:52,987
Chuck唯一能插入的就是他的小便袋
The only thing that Chuck is plugged into is his fucking piss bag.

283
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:02,630
好吧 Chuck被否了 我们要让他闭嘴
Okay, Chuck is dead and we're gonna just have to keep him quiet

284
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:05,133
因为这个地方到处都是
because this whole place is swarming with bored reporters

285

291
00:11:17,947 --> 00:11:20,648
假装你是去接他的 你就 当他是瞎子
Just pretend you're picking him up, you know, and he's blind.

别人不会冲你嚷嚷的
People don't shout at you

297
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,959

298
00:11:30,993 --> 00:11:33,228

312
00:12:05,427 --> 00:12:09,063
那有什么关系 副总统对我说 就快要宣布了
What's the problem? The Vice President told me it's as good as announced.

313
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:11,232
就快要 也就是 还没有
As good as announced is not announced.

我们宣布领养一条狗 温和的晨间新闻

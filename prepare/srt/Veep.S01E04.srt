1
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:17,110
副总统 第一季第4集

2
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:19,080
我到底是爲什麽要把午餐休息时间
Why on earth am I spending my lunch break

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,560
耗费在伟大的Chung州长图书发行会上?
at the great governor Chung's book launch?

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,350
至少好过看着Gary的漏勺下巴滴面汤
Because it's better than watching Gary drip that fucking noodle juice down his chin.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,680
老天 我只想顺点酱黄瓜就走
God, I'm gonna snort a line of tzatziki and go.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,590
我被革除"冗长辩论"的事烦得要死 连聊天都挤没了
I am so mired in filibuster reform, I've got no conversation.

7
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:32,680
- 你认识Chung吗? - 不熟
- Do you know Chung? - Not really.

8
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:35,150
- 嘿嘿! - Dan 好兄弟
- Heh-hey! - Dan, my man.

9
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,120
州长 很高兴见到你 老友
Governor. Good to see you, my friend.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,500
- 你最近如何? - 非常好
- How are you, sir? - I'm very well.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,650
- 噢 你想必是Amy了 - 正是
- Oh, and you must be Amy. - Yes.

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,640
那麽 Dan 副总统那边什麽态度?
So, Dan, how's it working out with the V.P.?

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,760
如果你愿意放下身段 我总是需要Daniel吾友帮助的
'Cause if you ever wanna step several rungs down the ladder, I could always use help from a fellow Daniel.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,350
Dan一心只想往上爬
Dan only climbs up ladders.

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,800
对 但有时欲登极巅 须下高峰
Yes, but sometimes you have to go down to go up.

16
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,150
- 我猜副总统是无暇拨冗了 - 对 她表示歉意
I assume the vice president would be too busy. Yes. She sends her apologies.

17
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,900
她在准备"会见新闻界" (美国NBC周日采访节目)
- She's prepping for "Meet the Press." - Ah.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,780
我则是要上"面对全国" (美国CBS采访节目)
I'll be on "Face the Nation."

19
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,440
但显然大家都会去给她捧场 我还是推了吧
But everyone will be watching her, so I guess I can just wing it.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,940
- 我是不是要给她签个名? - 不... 介意
- Shall I sign a book for her? - No... 'kay.

21
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,650
我最好四处走走
I'd better be going around myself,

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,240
确保和每个人都打个照面
make sure everyone gets to touch the hem of my garment.

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,070
- Dan 好兄弟 - 对
Dan, the man. All right.

24
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,930
"欲登极巅 须下高峰"
"You have to go down to go up."

25
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,250
- 什麽人啊 - 这句我得留着备用
- What a jerk. - I'm gonna steal that,

26
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,150
人家可是口绽莲花巧舌如簧
because he who speaks in maxims.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,630
- 能让我听着有深度 - 这个很不错 好像是玉米面包
Can sound wise. This is good. This is like cornbread.

28
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,460
你们好 孩子们
Hello, children.

29
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,640
- 你好 参议员 - 准备再找几个背后捅刀子的对象?
- Hello, senator. - You looking for some fresh backs to stab?

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,510
噢 Doyle参议员 这不过是游戏一场
Oh, senator Doyle, it's all part of the game.

31
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,980
是吗 告诉你 你不是想玩游戏吗 Danny?
Yeah, well, I'll tell you, you wanna play a game, Danny?

32
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,930
怎麽不试试用老二玩弄iPad呢?
Why don't you try working an iPad with your dick?

33
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,800
不行 他早就过度开发那里导致腕道症候群了 (因长期重复性动作导致的疾病)
No, he's already got carpal tunnel in that area.

34
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,010
你对我没什麽建设性的建议吗 Amy?
You have nothing constructive to say to me, Amy?

35
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,550
关于绿色産业的吗?
Is this about clean jobs?

36
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,750
噢 加了俩搞石油的还能这麽叫吗?
Oh, is that what they call it still with two oil guys on it?

37
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:55,550
哇 你们要买多少喷漆 才能给那坨代谢物包金衣啊
Wow, you're gonna have to buy a lot of spray cans to paint that turd gold.

38
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,520
人人有其权力范围 参议员 即使是副总统
Everyone has limits to their power, senator, even the vice president.

39
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,870
对 而我有权撤离
Yeah, and I have the power to withdraw,

40
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,030
这也正是我现在要做的
which is what I'm gonna do right now.

41
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,610
他说的撤离 他... 他不是指
When he said withdraw, he's... he's not talking about

42
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,700
撤离革除"冗长辩论"工作 对吧?
withdrawing from filibuster reform, though, right?

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,880
- 不! 不是吧! - 你以爲他在说什麽?
- No! No! - What do you think he's talking about?

44
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,390
我以爲是指他要撤离谈话
I assumed it was withdraw from the conversation.

45
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,000
除了天主教徒和管家谁会把撤离当动词用?
Who uses withdraw as a fuckin' verb besides catholics and butlers?

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,880
- 也就以色列军方偶尔用用 - 你以爲我不知道啊? 你少耍我
Maybe the Israeli military every once in a while. Yeah, you think I don't know? You're fucking with me.

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,940
- 少来 快走 我们回去 - 噢 不不 不行 我要留下
No. Come on, let's just head back. Oh, no, no. No way. I'm staying right here.

48
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,560
要办公可以用网络 对吧? Chung之变革
You gotta network to get work, baby. All right? Chung for change.

49
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,170
谢谢 非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you so much.

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:36,840
我们有工作
We've got jobs.

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,830
- 绿色産业 - 绿色産业 革除"冗长辩论"
- Clean jobs. - Clean jobs. Filibuster reform.

52
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,030
- 对 重点说那个 - 好 知道我们需要什麽吗? 更寻常更亲民的话题
- Yeah, hit that hard. - Right. You know what we need? We need some normal, regular-people stuff.

53
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:44,870
我有个主意
I got an idea.

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,360
你可以谈谈聚光灯下你的上唇多麽水润
You could talk about how you always get a sweaty upper lip underneath studio lights.

55
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,900
展现你的寻常
That shows you're normal.

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,430
我说的绝对是完全不同的寻常 Gary
I'm really talking about a different kind of normal, Gary.

57
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:54,420
噢 好吧
Oh, okay.

58
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,000
最后以闲聊结尾 对吧?
Small talk's gonna happen at the end, right?

59
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,470
- 对 - Gregory是红人队的粉丝
- Right. - Gregory's a redskins fan.

60
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,410
- 他兴许会提起橄榄球 - 橄榄球
- He'll probably bring up football. - Football.

61
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:02,040
而我是个...
And I am a...

62
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,320
乌鸦队球迷 所以...
Ravens fan, so...

63
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,920
副总统女士 你的乌鸦队今年表现如何?
Madam vice president, how are your Ravens doing this year?

64
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,320
我家乌鸦超赞 知道原因吗
My Ravens are gold and I'll tell you why.

65
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:13,150
因爲我们有Joe Flacco做四分卫 (NFL著名球星 虽年轻但战绩斐然)
Because we have Joe Flacco as our quarterback.

66
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,660
- 对 对 - 而且...
- Yes, yes. - And...

67
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,860
红人队今年的快攻打法很不错
Well, the redskins have a great running game this year

68
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,230
说实话 你们那个外接员
and, honestly, that receiving corps over there,

69
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:21,540
Anquan Boldin 对你们可没啥好处
Anquan Boldin, not looking good for you.

70
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,620
- Anquan? - 乌鸦队的翼锋
Anquan? A receiver on the Ravens.

71
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,820
好吧 我怎麽可能记得住
Okay, well, I'm not gonna remember that.

72
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,140
- 那可不成 - 知道吗 没关系的
- That's not good. - It doesn't matter.

73
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,240
以啤酒的名义发誓 乌鸦铁定赢
You wanna bet a beer that the Ravens will win.

74
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,080
- 啤酒让我胀气 - 你也可以谈谈那个...
- Beer makes me so gassy. - You can talk about that...

75
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,850
关于它怎麽让你腹胀的 啤酒
about how it always bloats you, beer.

76
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,580
- 很赞的点子 - Chung怎麽样?
- That's a good one. - How was Chung?

77
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,340
他有没有做这个动作 让你不知道是该抱他 还是把他钉上十字架?
Did he do this thing where you don't know if you're supposed to hug him or crucify him?

78
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,080
顺便一提 我是想钉他十字架的
Which, by the way, makes me wanna crucify him.

79
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
- 我没留下听他的演讲 - 给我看看
- I did not stay for his speech. - Let me see this.

80
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,120
"旗开得胜" (另有同名的橄榄球纪录电影)
"The Good Fight."

81
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,760
- 我知道 这标题... - 拜了个托! Sue?
- I know. The title... - Puh-lease! Sue?

82
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,280
- 在 - 帮我处理这个
- Yep. - Handle this for me.

83
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,520
- 你想让我撕了它? - 对
- Do you want me to shred it? - Yeah.

84
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,460
- 我是不是该烧了这团狗剩? - 好
- Should I fire up the shit eater? - Yeah.

85
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,970
别别 先等等 他在扉页给你留了几句
No, no. Wait a second. He scrawled something in the front for you.

86
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,370
"致副总统Salina Meyer"...
"To vice president Salina Meyer"...

87
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,980
居然写成了"a"... "仰慕你的同道"
with an "a"... "from an admiring wannabe."

88
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,240
真是个昏蛋
What an e-hole.

89
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,990
- 把"昏"换成"混" - 真是堆华盛顿出品的狗剩
Changed the "a" to an "e." What a bunch of Washington bullshit that is.

90
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:16,110
我真是烦死了... 嘿 Gary 我...
I am so tired of... hey, Gary, I...

91
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,310
我是说 同道? 他显然是在开玩笑 对吧?
I mean, wannabe? He's obviously making a joke, right?

92
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,150
他不会真的以爲他有能力
He doesn't really think that he's some sort

93
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:24,560
胜任副总统竞选人吧
of credible vice presidential candidate.

94
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,810
唔 魅力不凡的战争英雄
Mm, charismatic war hero.

95
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,330
对 但我是说 总统
Yeah, but, I mean, the president

96
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,570
总是会支持现任副总统吧
always sticks with the incumbent veep.

97
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,980
而且 他不会让选择你变成天大的失误
Plus, he doesn't wanna look like he made a massive error picking you.

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,220
那可真可爱
Well, that was lovely.

99
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,010
- 他被我套牢了... 你是不是这个意思... - 我不是那个意思
- He's stuck with me... is that what... - I don't mean it like that.

100
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,150
我是指好的套牢 就像维系婚姻什麽的
I meant good stuck, like if your marriage lasts or whatever.

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,710
- 总统不会抛弃你的 - 你安静点行不? 怎麽...?
The president's not gonna ditch you. Would you be quiet? What...?

102
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:52,160
- 需要我派Scott收集Chung的情报吗 鉴于这些风声? - 不不不不不
Want me to have Scott put together a file on Chung, - given the noise? - No. No, no, no, no.

103
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
别让他知道你担心了 别当他是回事
Do not let him know that you're worried, do not make it a thing.

104
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,990
- 对 Amy 别当他是回事 好吗? - 好
- Yeah, Amy, don't make it a thing, okay? - Okay.

105
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,580
Ame?
Ame?

106
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:05,400
不过 倘若大势果真如此
Although, if those wheels are in motion anyway,

107
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,190
那我确实需要早做准备 比如
then I would say go ahead and, you know,

108
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,740
收集情报 什麽的
put a file together, you know.

109
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,290
知道我最烦什麽吗?
You know what I'm sick of?

110
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,810
Chung可能把某人救出起火坦克的蠢故事
That stupid story of Chung supposedly pulling some guy out of a burning tank.

111
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:20,450
拜托 爲什麽军人行应尽义务都能得奖章?
Come on, why do guys in the army get a medal for doing their job?

112
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,180
那家伙依然严重烧伤了 就算真事 Chung也不够及时
The guy still had severe burns. If anything, Chung was too late.

113
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,940
喂喂 你的桌子在后面
Whoa, whoa. Your desk is in the back.

114
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
- 这是中立区 - 对 所以我征用了
- This is neutral territory. - Yep. So I'm claiming it.

115
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:34,250
- Sue 请告诉他侵权规则好吗? - 你觉得我是幼儿园老师吗 Mike?
Sue, would you like to tell him about the encroachment rules? Do I look like a kindergarten teacher to you, Mike?

116
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,890
- 说实话 没错 - 再说一遍?
- Actually, yes. - Excuse me?

117
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,490
呃 不 你不是 好吧 随你便
Uh, no, you don't. Okay, go ahead.

118
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,720
- 我去用你后面的桌子 - 做什麽用 配餐台?
- I'm gonna use your desk in the back. - As what, a pantry?

119
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,350
噢 找到了
Oh, here we go.

120
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,810
看谁来了 伙计们! 你们最爱的Jonah哟
Look who it is, everybody! It's your favorite Jonah.

121
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:50,440
你都不是你妈的最爱Jonah Jonah
You're not even your mom's favorite Jonah, Jonah.

122
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,610
别改"会见新闻界"的谈话要点 好吗? 我刚准备好
Don't be changing the talking points for my "Meet the Press" thing. Okay? I am prepped.

123
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,790
我是来传达总统的些微要求的
I come bearing a very minor request from the president.

124
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,070
他想用遥控器指挥我吗?
Does he want to operate me by remote control?

125
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,740
不 那在科技上不可能
No. That's not technologically possible.

126
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,660
呃 总统希望你不要过分强调革除"冗长辩论"
Um, potus would appreciate it if you didn't go too hard on filibuster reform.

127
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,590
你说什麽呢? 那是我最具代表性的 副总统改革行动
What are you talking about? That's my defining vice presidential crusade.

128
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,530
本任期仅专注于经济
The administration is totally focused on the economy.

129
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,420
- 周末愉快 好吗? - 夫人
- Have a great weekend, okay? - Ma'am.

130
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,420
- 夫人 你也是 - 嗯 谢谢你
- Ma'am, you, too. - Yeah, thank you very much.

131
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,970
- 夫人 - 我要去收拾东西了
- Ma'am. - I need to gather my things.

132
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,810
还有件事... 这些该加水了
I'll tell you something else... these need water, okay?

133
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,710
- 好吗? - 明白
- Got it. - Okay.

134
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:27,640
- 好 - 夫人 总统更希望你选择移民法案...
So, ma'am, potus would like your new chosen subject to be immigration reform...

135
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,700
美国公民被非法移民抢走工作 诸如此类
Americans losing jobs to illegals, et cetera.

136
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,050
我整个初期竞选都是爲移民特赦说话
I spoke in favor of immigration amnesty all during my primary campaign.

137
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,900
- 嘿 最近如何? - 无意冒犯 夫人
- Hey, how's it going? - Well, with respect, ma'am,

138
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,540
你真以爲有人记得你的初期竞选吗?
do you think anybody's gonna remember your primary campaign?

139
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,940
除了开头半句 我没察觉到
In spite of your preface, I did not detect

140
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,430
剩下的问题中有一丝尊重
a whole lot of respect in that question.

141
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,740
我的初衷是淡化选区的回忆
You know, I meant that more as a slight against

142
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:55,340
而非攻讦你的竞选效能
the power of recollection of the electorate and not as an attack on the potency of your campaign.

143
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,940
那爲什麽你不直接那麽说呢?
Well, why didn't you say that, then?

144
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,420
噢 因爲你的社交能力是狼教的
Oh, because you have the social skills of someone who was raised by wolves.

145
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,550
噢 还有把中国强调成贸易伙伴
Oh, and pump up China as a trading partner.

146
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,310
我们必须坚持强调这点
We gotta keep nudging that one along.

147
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,280
我该回白宫去了 天啊 我真喜欢这说法
I gotta get back to the White House. God, I love saying that.

148
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,620
天佑总统
Well, God bless the president, you know.

149
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,270
他真是个好人
I mean, he's really a great man,

150
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,990
但他真的让我彻底乳酸了
but he is busting my fuckin' lady balls here.

151
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,870
还有强调中国?
And pump up China?

152
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,290
那算是对Chung的刺探吗?
Is that some sort of dig about Chung?

153
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,440
好吧 我想我们回不了家了
Okay, so I guess we're not going home.

154
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,950
- 对 Sue? - 在
- Yeah. Sue? - Yep.

155
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,900
- 我们不走了 - 嗷
- We're staying. - Aw.

156
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,570
周日 早7:45 副总统官邸

157
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:37,350
- 周六晚上玩得开心吗? - 还不错
- Did you have a good Saturday night? - It was okay.

158
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,570
我的Leviathan拉链坏了
My zipper on my Leviathan broke,

159
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,080
我不得不开车到处找修理替换
so I had to drive around trying to find a replacement.

160
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,470
- 你怎麽过的? - 你问我怎麽过的? 我晚上7点上床
What did you do? You know what I did? I went to bed at 7:00 P.M.

161
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:49,970
晚上7点 还是周六晚 罹患疟疾的人都睡得比那晚
- Ooh. - 7:00 P.M. on a Saturday night. Even people who are dying of malaria stay up later than that.

162
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,820
他们睡不着的 因爲咳嗽
Well, they can't sleep because they're coughing.

163
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,700
嗨 伙计们 我准备好了 马上下来
Hi, guys. I'm all set. I'll be there in just a second.

164
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,020
- 好 好好好 - 明白
- Okay, yeah. Yeah, yeah. - All right.

165
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,540
我该走了 至于你嘛?
I gotta go, but you know what?

166
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,100
想呆多久呆多久 我完事给你打电话 好吗?
Hang out here as long as you like and I'll call you afterwards, okay?

167
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,590
- 我不能和你一起走吗? - 不 我不想他们看到你
Can't I just leave now with you? No, I don't want them to see you.

168
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,330
- 这些额外规程... 真是太怪了 - 我知道 但我可是副总统
All these extra rules... it's kind of weird. I know, but I am the vice president.

169
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,090
噢 对 你当然是
Oh, yes, you are.

170
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,230
听到你这麽说就让我性致勃发呢
Hearing you say that gives me a massive hard-on.

171
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:15,000
噢 我的确是副总统
Oh. I am the vice president.

172
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,190
噢 宝贝 我准备吃午餐了
Oh, baby, I'm ready to launch.

173
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,890
我准备吃你了
And I'm ready to eat you up.

174
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,550
噢 早上第二回 没想到你有这能耐呢
Oh, second breakfast. I didn't know you had it in you.

175
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,450
噢 老天 我真想水乳交融
Oh, God. Oh, I want it in me.

176
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,750
- 行了 - 拜
- All right. - Bye.

177
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:32,270
我要好好欣赏你的翘臀
Yeah. I'm gonna watch your ass move. Yeah.

178
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:33,940
- 嗨 伙计们 - 嘿
- Hi, you guys. - Hey.

179
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,800
- 你气色不错 - 噢 谢谢
- You look pretty. - Oh, thank you.

180
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,950
- 你们怎麽样? - 很好
- How are you guys? - Great.

181
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:41,280
- 准备好了? 都带齐了? - 噢 是的
- All set? You got everything? - Oh, yes.

182
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,500
- 我去拿点东西 - 你周六晚过得如何?
呃 还不赖
- I just have to get my stuff. - How was your Saturday night? Um, it was fine.

183
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,510
- 我帮你开 - 谢谢
- Here, I'll get that. - Thank you.

184
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:52,000
- Mike! - 噢 嘿
- Mike! - Oh, hey.

185
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,470
只是在想象你在"会见新闻界"上的完美发挥
Just visualizing you kicking ass on "Meet the Press."

186
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,080
你怎麽这麽累的样子? 你啥都没干
Why are you so tired? You don't do anything.

187
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,470
这是Scott对Chung的调查
Here's the research Scott pulled on Chung.

188
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,750
注意第一页
Check out page one.

189
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,440
他生于中国 然后他父亲才得到国籍
He was born back in China before his dad got his citizenship,

190
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,740
所以他不可能当总统或副总统
so he can't be president or vice president.

191
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,820
- 真的? 真是个好消息 - 嗯哼
- Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, that's good news.

192
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,660
- "会见新闻界"还有更多好消息 - 噢 真的?
- More good news for "Meet the Press." - Oh, yeah?

193
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,150
David Gregory生病了
David Gregory is ill.

194
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,060
- Sam Finnegan补缺 - 哈哈 雏儿一个
- Sam Finnegan is the fill-in. - Ho ho, a virgin.

195
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,040
我要把他吃干抹净了
Oh, God, I'm gonna eat him up.

196
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,410
怎麽了?
What?

197
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,090
- 那样体育话题就要改变了 - 别紧张
- Well, that changes the sports stuff. - No panic.

198
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,060
我们只需把红人改成Finnegan支持的球队
We'll just change the redskins to whatever Finnegan's team is.

199
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,850
- Finnegan支持哪个队? - 我确信他是芝加哥熊的粉丝
- What is Finnegan's team? - I'm pretty sure he's a Bears fan.

200
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,010
- 确信? - Mike 你确信? 那可帮不上忙
- Pretty sure? - Mike, you're pretty sure? Exactly. That doesn't help.

201
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,850
没关系 你要聊的是乌鸦队
It doesn't matter because you're gonna talk about the Ravens.

202
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,430
我知道我是乌鸦球迷
I know that I'm a Ravens fan,

203
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:49,410
但万一Finnegan也是乌鸦球迷呢 你明白吗?
but, like, what if Finnegan is a Ravens fan, too, you know?

204
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,990
- 一支队伍可玩不起来 对吧? - 电子游戏里就可以
A team can't play itself, can it? You can in video games.

205
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:56,540
有人说你的移民政策
Some people say your immigration policy

206
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,360
取决于你的就业计划
is at odds with your jobs program.

207
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,030
- 对此你怎麽回应? - 我会如此回应...
How would you respond to that? Well, I would respond like this...

208
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,710
我会说经济在我当初声明之后
I would say that the economy has changed a great deal

209
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:10,360
已经有明显转变 总统和我都同意
since I made those statements and the president and I agree

210
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,100
美国公民理当优先
that Americans have to come first.

211
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,040
干得好 完美的太极推手
That's my girl. Olympic-style backflip.

212
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,470
我强烈相信...
And I believe very strongly...

213
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:20,270
- 那是汗 人中的汗 - 那是反光
- That's sweat. That's lip sweat. - That's shimmer.

214
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:24,330
你今天没有怎麽提到 参议院革除"冗长辩论"计划
You haven't spoken much today about the Senate filibuster reform.

215
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,670
我这麽说吧... 要想做出变革
Well, I'll say this... in order to reform,

216
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,820
就要有所行动
you have to perform.

217
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,380
- 她把话题引到冗长辩论了! - 等Jonah 打来了
She got the filibuster in! Just waiting for Jonah. Here he is.

218
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,540
- 噢 真的? - 您好 男性外生殖器增大诊所
Oh, yeah? Hello, penis enlargement clinic.

219
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,020
Mike 到底是谁的失职 你还是她?
Mike, who is incompetent, you or her?

220
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:41,350
她现在说的可是革除"冗长辩论"
Because she just talked about filibuster reform.

221
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,310
他自己问她的
He asked her.

222
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,550
我的意向很简单 我的意向就是... 同意
My message is simple, my message is this... Yes.

223
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,570
- 谢谢 副总统女士 - 不客气
- Thank you, madam vice president. - Absolutely.

224
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,740
Sam 我得问你一下... 你是熊队球迷
Sam, I just have to ask you... you're a Bears fan.

225
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,440
- 对吧? - 被你看穿了
- Is that right? - Guilty.

226
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,160
- 她提了体育话题没? - 她现在在说
- She do the sports yet? - She's doing it now.

227
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,110
我们一点也不担心 有Flacco... 万事安矣
We're not nervous at all. With Flacco... forget about it.

228
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,750
我赌瓶啤酒 我们触底得分赢得比赛
I'll bet you a beer that we win by a T.D.

229
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,590
那Ray Rice? 他的优势也很大 (与Flacco同爲乌鸦队员)
What about Ray Rice? Hell of a lead runner.

230
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,430
Ray Rice Ray Rice Ray...

231
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:09,160
这个 他 呃... Ray Rice 他打得不错
Well, he, uh... Ray Rice, he play nice.

232
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,150
- 副总统 - 非常感谢
- Vice president. - Thank you so much.

233
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,640
我们下周再见
We'll be back next week,

234
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:17,030
因爲每逢周日 "会见新闻界"
because if it's Sunday, it's "Meet the Press."

235
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,930
你会看Danny Chung的"面对全国"节目吗?
Will you be watching Danny Chung on "Face the Nation"?

236
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,340
呃 我会的
Uh, you know, I would,

237
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,220
不过我还有牌局 所以我恐怕得跳过
but I've got a game of solitaire going on, so I think I'll give that a skip.

238
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,440
- 他掌管长期环城公路资金 很有总统潜力 - 噢 是吗?
Long-term beltway money's on him - as presidential material. - Oh, really?

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,880
那我会很吃惊的 严格说来他不算美国人
Well, I'd be surprised because technically he's not an American.

240
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,380
我是说 因爲他出生地不是这里
I mean, because he wasn't, um, born here,

241
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,620
不是因爲他是半个中国人...
you know, not because he's half Chine...

242
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:45,290
- 你懂的 因爲他的父母... - 我该走了
- You know, 'cause his parents... - Well, I've gotta go.

243
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,920
- 好吧 - 很荣幸能与你谈话
- Okay. - But it was a pleasure talking to you.

244
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,170
非常感谢 你弄好没?
Thank you so much. Did you get it?

245
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,500
- 搞定了 - 噢...
- I got it. - Oh...

246
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:57,300
他们没有录下 对吧? 我戴着麦克风 但我估计没开
Listen, they wouldn't have recorded that, right? I had the mic on, but I don't think it was hot.

247
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,640
- 你觉得它开着吗? - 我只能祈祷它没有
- Do you think that it was on? - I hope to God they didn't.

248
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,450
我没有说因爲他是半个中国人所以就是坏人
I didn't say he was bad because he's part Chinese.

249
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,310
- 没 没有 - 身爲中国人没什麽坏的
- No, no. - It's not bad to be Chinese.

250
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,960
- 你能和录音师谈谈吗? - 我不能 这样会显得小题大做
Can you go speak to the sound guy? I can't do it because it'll make it look like a thing.

251
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,800
我不可以小题大做
I don't wanna make it look like a thing,

252
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,600
- 也许我能... - 我来吧
so maybe I can... I'll do it.

253
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,270
不不不 Gary Gary
No, no, no. Gary, Gary, Gary.

254
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,060
- Gary Gary 过来 - 我去谈吧
Gary, come. - I'll do it.

255
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,300
- 我觉得他应该去和录音师谈谈 - 好吧
I think actually he should go talk to the sound guy. - Yeah. - Okay.

256
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,390
- 你知道我该怎麽说吗? - 你自告奋勇的 你没计划吗?
Do you have any ideas on what I should say? You offered to do this. What was your plan?

257
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,950
我的计划是过去了再见招拆招
My plan was to go over there and get some ideas on what to say.

258
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:28,700
Gary Gary 稍微提点一下就行
Gary, Gary, just give it a light touch.

259
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,810
- 别太深入 - 好
- No import to it. - Okay.

260
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,010
- 那是什麽意思? - 就和他聊聊
- What does that mean? - Just talk to him

261
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,560
同事和同事那种
like working guy to working guy.

262
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,100
- 随意一点 - 明白了 单对单
- It's casual. - Got it. Mano a mano.

263
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,810
- 好吧 - 噢 上帝啊
- Okay. - Oh, Jesus Christ.

264
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:44,620
即使用西班牙语 听起来也不像能奏效的感觉
Even in Spanish, you know, it doesn't sound like it's gonna work.

265
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:47,360
也许只是我太多心
It totally might have just been me,

266
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,670
不过... 最后是不是有点小问题什麽的?
but kind of... didn't it sound a little glitchy in the end or anything like that?

267
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,600
- 你是说我没尽职? - 不 天啊 不是的
- You saying I can't do my job? - No. Oh, God, no.

268
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,250
- 很糟吗? - 他刚从笑脸变成了苦瓜脸
It's bad? Well, he just went from a smiley guy to a frowny guy.

269
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,490
我只想确保一切正常 你懂的
I just need to know if everything's okay, you know.

270
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,410
同事对同事 你懂的
Working guy to working guy, you know.

271
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:08,200
- 听着 女同事 - 好吧
- Listen, working girl. - Okay.

272
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,450
我没听到任何问题
Yeah. I didn't hear any glitches.

273
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:14,760
我只听到一堆废话 了了?
All I heard was the sound of a fuckup, okay?

274
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,250
- 他完全是个外行 - 对
- He was completely out of his element. - Yeah.

275
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,820
我同意 我同意
I agree. I agree.

276
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,240
嘿 已经有媒体对此感兴趣了
Hey, we're getting some press interest in this already.

277
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,240
- 噢 天啊 - 在哪? 在哪?
- Oh, God. - Where? Where?

278
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,100
还没有定案 还没成定局
It's still non-narrative. No momentum yet.

279
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,910
夫人 鉴于现状 也许你需要我留在办公室里
Ma'am, I thought you might want me in the office, given the circumstances.

280
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,830
- 你怎麽知道现状如何的? - 我可是Sue
- How do you know about the circumstances? - Well, I'm Sue.

281
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,130
全知全能是我的工作 Amy
It's my job to know everything, Amy.

282
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:37,560
- 所以肯定是传扬开来了? - 不 不 不是传扬的那种开来
So it's definitely out there out there? No, no, it's not out there out there.

283
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,110
我听说了 Dan 就是传扬的那个开来 所以我才会留在这个其中 Dan
I heard about it, Dan, so it sort of is out there out there. That's why I'm in here in here, Dan.

284
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,320
- Jonah来了 Jonah来了 - 噢 该死!
- Jonah's coming. Jonah's coming. - Oh, fuck!

285
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,520
- 嘘! - 好吧 我该怎麽办?
- Shh! - All right, what do I do?

286
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,410
万一他不知道是传扬的那样开来? 我该跟他说什麽?
What if he doesn't know that it's not definitely out there out there? Should I tell him that?

287
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,260
你不会想把把柄给那个人形炸弹的
You don't wanna give a loaded gun to that walking silo.

288
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,710
- 别太当回事 除非真的出大事 - 你有没有...
- Don't make it a thing until it's a thing. - Do you have any...

289
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,340
坏消息 伙计们
Bad news, everyone.

290
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,340
- 此事还未流到主流媒体... - 那是断章取义
This hasn't hit the mainstream media yet... It was out of context.

291
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,500
但是弗吉尼亚州的Portsmouth 有吊臂断裂砸到了船
But a crane has collapsed onto a ship at Portsmouth, Virginia.

292
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,940
噢 感谢... 神啊 太可怕了
Oh, thank... God, how horrible.

293
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,450
等等 什麽是断章取义?
Wait, what was out of context?

294
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,870
我们以爲你要唠叨革除"冗长辩论"的事
Um, we thought you were gonna give me shit about filibuster reform.

295
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,520
噢 白宫还不是很清楚此事
Oh, well, the White House is very much under the moon

296
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,640
不过我们重申一遍
about that, but let's reboot.

297
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,740
总统只坚持经济问题
The president is stuck in economic talks.

298
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,860
- 我们需要副统亲场 - 需要什麽? 副总统亲自到场
- We need a V.P.V.P. - A what? A vice presidential visual presence.

299
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,270
你不能生造缩略词 Jonah
You can't just make up acronyms, Jonah.

300
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:22,260
- 总得有人去做 Mike - 不 没人会做
Somebody has to, Mike. - No, they don't.

301
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,560
呃 好吧 我们该赶过去了
Uh, okay, well, then, we should head on down there.

302
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,600
- 我们快行动吧 尽快赶到 - 谢谢 谢谢
- Let's get the ball rolling - Thank you. Thank you.

303
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,680
我们会处理好的
.let's get there as soon as possible Yeah, we've got it handled.

304
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,150
噢 Jonah 这身很衬你
Oh, Jonah, that's a good look for you.

305
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,000
你管这身叫什麽? 双便服?谢了 Mike 不过今天周日
What do you call that? Bi-casual? Thanks, Mike, but it's Sunday.

306
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:38,770
我工作努力迅速 腿部热量积蓄 所以我决定随风飘荡一下
I work hard, I work fast, and I get hot legs. I say let the whale hang loose.

307
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,790
- 我招谁惹谁了? - 举手表决
- Who am I offending? - Show of hands.

308
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:41,770
都有
Right here.

309
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,540
好吧 我猜我们应付得不错
O- kay, well, I think that worked out pretty good.

310
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,700
刚刚证实... 目前2人遇难 24人受伤
Just confirmed... Two fatalities, 24 injured so far.

311
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,770
我不是那个意思 Dan 我们得去趟医院
I didn't mean it like that. Dan, we're going to a hospital.

312
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,860
你有没有能换的正装?
Do you have a suit you can change into?

313
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,470
- 我有5套 - 好吧
- I have five. - Okay.

314
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,030
你有没有不是圣诞老人服
Do you have something that can fit

315
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:03,560
而且能让McClintock穿得下的?
the McClintock shape that's not a Santa suit?

316
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,650
- 我会找到的 - 我们要去医院
I got something. We're going to a hospital.

317
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:08,520
可不是万圣节要糖果
We're not going trick or treating.

318
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,840
- 副总统女士... - 是的
- Madam vice president... - Yes.

319
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,490
这是Ashley 医院院长
This is Ashley, the hospital administrator.

320
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,830
谢谢你能来 这意义很重大
Thank you so much for coming. It really means a lot.

321
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:26,060
- 谢谢 - 我跟你说...
- Thank you. - Well, let me tell you something...

322
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,990
因爲美国人民在这里出现 是职位赋予我的特权之一
being here for the American people is one of the privileges of this job.

323
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,610
- 当然了 这是一项悲哀的特权 - 是的
- It's a sad privilege, of course... - Yes.

324
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,840
但不管怎样也是一项特权
But it's a privilege nonetheless.

325
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,220
女士 我不知道这些人是不是都活着
Ma'am, I don't know if all these people are bereaving,

326
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,950
- 所以你就正常聊天就好了 好吗? - 好的
- so just converse generally, okay? - Right.

327
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:40,670
- 正常聊天? 聊什麽? 聊天气吗? - 不是天气
Converse generally? What about? The weather? Not about the weather.

328
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:43,020
不过现在确实是反季节高温天气 是吧?
It is unseasonably warm, though, okay?

329
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,530
副总统女士 要是你跟我来的话 我会给你介绍一些家庭
So, madam vice president, if you'll just come with me, I'll show you to some of our families.

330
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,400
嗯 怎麽安排都行
Oh, well, however I can be of service.

331
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,430
你好吗 先生? 噢 天哪 你伤得真重
How do you do, sir? Oh, my goodness, you got so hurt.

332
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:54,620
- 这是家很好的医院对吧? - 是的 女士
- Well, it's a great hospital, isn't it? - Yes, ma'am.

333
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,530
天哪 看你的脖子 先生 千万别转头
Oh, dear, look at your neck. Hi, sir. Don't turn your head.

334
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:00,550
我来握握你的手
I'll give you a little squeeze on your hand.

335
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,690
- 嗯 你看起来还挺好 - 其实我不好
- Well, you seem just fine. - I'm not really.

336
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:06,420
- 内伤 - 内伤 嗯
- Internal. - Internal. Hmm.

337
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,150
这是家属...他们在等儿子的消息
This is a family... they're waiting to hear about their son.

338
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,890
- 噢 - 等等 不不 还不到时候
- Oh. - Hold on. No, no, not yet.

339
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:12,610
这是私人时间 不是照相的时候
This is a private moment. This is not a photo op.

340
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:15,960
- 世界变化快啊 - 嗯
- It's amazing how the world changes. - Mm.

341
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,470
上一分钟你还在享受美妙的阳光...
One minute, you're enjoying this amazing sunshine...

342
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:22,420
呃 现在是反季节高温
Well, it's unseasonably warm.

343
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:25,880
下一分钟 你的世界就支离破碎了
And the next, your whole world's gone to pieces.

344
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,250
- 噢 天哪 - 这是给他动手术的大夫
- Oh, gosh. - This is his surgeon.

345
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:30,380
- 你好吗 先生? - Graber医生
- How do you do, sir? - Dr. Graber.

346
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:33,230
- 医生 我儿子有消息吗? - Sam会挺过来的
Any news, doctor, about our son? Sam's going to make it.

347
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,430
好了 同学们 我这里有料了
Okay, guys, I got a little sound bite for y'all to nibble on right here.

348
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,630
- 噢 这太好了 - 非常好
- Oh, that is just fantastic. - Very good.

349
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:42,700
医生 我们感谢你的辛勤工作
Doctor, we appreciate your hard work.

350
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,830
- 好消息 - 我只是想说 太感谢你们
- Good news. - I just wanna say how grateful we are

351
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,050
这些优秀的医生和护士了
to all of our most capable doctors and nurses.

352
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,820
太感谢了
So grateful.

353
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,490
而且我也要说 如果我们发现
And I'd also like to say if, for some reason, we find out

354
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,520
这样的意外是由某些人的疏忽而造成的话
that there was negligence that caused this accident,

355
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,020
那些负有责任的人
those who are responsible

356
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,750
必须要向白宫交待
are gonna have the White House to answer to.

357
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,050
- 就是! - 就是这样
- Yeah! - That's right.

358
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,540
谢谢你能来这里 副总统女士
Thank you for being here, madam vice president.

359
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,570
- 你是个好女人 - 是的!
- You are a good woman. - Yeah!

360
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,910
你不怕说出自己的想法
And you're not afraid to say what's on your mind.

361
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:15,970
- 噢 - Danny Chung...
- Oh. - Danny Chung...

362
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,890
我...我一直努力尽量诚实
I... I always try to speak as honestly as I can.

363
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:24,030
我听见你说那些人的话了 我会投票给你的
I heard what you said about those people. You'd get my vote.

364
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:26,310
因爲严格来说他不是美国人 (奥观海同志中枪了)
'Cause technically he's n an American.

365
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,660
我是说...
I mean...

366
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,940
他们接管了我们的口岸 就像是他们在侵略我们一样
They're taking over our ports. It's like they've invaded us.

367
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,460
是啊 现在他们觉得他们可以做总统了?
Yeah, and now they think they can be president?

368
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,670
- 没门! - 这是白宫 不是黄宫!
- No way! - Come on, this is the White House, not the Yellow House.

369
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,160
加油 Selina!
Come on, Selina!

370
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,380
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

371
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:49,320
你得马上给Chung打电话 Amy
You have to get Chung on the phone right away, Amy.

372
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,450
- 把这个事了结掉 Amy - 是 正在打
- Shut this thing down, Amy. - Yeah, dialing now.

373
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,450
好了 他接了
Here, he's picking up.

374
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,560
- 什麽? 我... - 噢 你好
- What? I... - Oh. Hello.

375
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,390
是的 副总统在线上等你
Hi. Yes, I have the vice president for you.

376
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:01,630
州长吗? 嗨 你好吗?
Governor? Hi. How are you?

377
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,460
我不...我不知道你看了今天的
I don't... I don't know if you saw the footage today

378
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,320
"会见新闻界"没有?
from "Meet the Press,"

379
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,290
但是那不是我的本意 而且那也不是我真正的想法
but, you know, that is not what I meant and it certainly isn't what I think.

380
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,810
- Gary 可以等会再系安全带 - 那我们这麽说吧...
- Gary, the belt can wait. - Let's just put it this way...

381
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:19,750
当时我真正想说的是...我的苍天啊!
what I was trying to say was... Jesus Christ!

382
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:22,460
- 上帝啊! 噢! - 噢 天哪
Oh, my God! Oh!

383
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,990
Gary 你刚才把我的肉...
Oh, God. Gary, that was my fucking flesh that you just...

384
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:28,260
- 你好? - 给按进去了
- Hello? - ...trapped in there.

385
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,390
- 语音信箱了 接着打 - 对不起
- Voice mail. Keep trying. - I'm so sorry.

386
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:32,940
- 好了 你够了 - 好的
- All right, that's enough. - Okay.

387
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,500
(副总统)很长一段时间之内都不能出席
there is not gonna be a lot of availability for a while.

388
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,600
Jennifer 说实话 我家的窗子都比 副总统现在的时间表安排空位多
Jennifer, quite frankly, I had more windows in my first apartment than the V.P. currently has in her schedule.

389
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,470
- 怎麽了? - 好吧 你知道吗?
- What's going on? - Well, you know what?

390
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,830
如果Chung州长不回电话的话 我可以以藐视本办公室灭了他
If governor Chung doesn't call back, I can just take him down for disrespecting the office.

391
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,000
- 这个怎麽样? - 可以
- How about that? - Yes.

392
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,320
我们刚才流失了革除"冗长辩论"的支持者
We just lost the numbers on filibuster reform.

393
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,250
- 你刚才说什麽? - 是的 是的
- What did you just say? - Yeah, yeah.

394
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,960
Doyle参议员刚刚收回对你的支持
Senator Doyle has just withdrawn his support.

395
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:02,300
因爲Amy在Chung的新书发布会上说的一些话
Something Amy said at Chung's book launch.

396
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,540
他还在爲绿色産业而生气
He was still upset about clean jobs,

397
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,480
这个是你的责任 Dan 因爲你把Sidney Purcell放到工作小组里了
which is on you, Dan, because you put Sidney Purcell on the task force.

398
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,070
是啊! 你知道吗? 我要怪的是乔治华盛顿!
Oh, sure! You know what? I blame George Washington.

399
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,980
如果不是他创立了现在政府的形式 那我们就不用...
If he hadn't started this whole form of government,

400
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:14,700
好吧 好吧 别吵了!
- then we wouldn't...- Okay, okay, stop squabbling!

401
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,640
我现在应该怎麽做?
What am I supposed to do now?

402
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:17,750
告诉我
Tell me that.

403
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,260
我应不应该给Doyle打电话求他回心转意?
I'm supposed to call Doyle and beg him to come back?

404
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:25,040
我是美国副总统 你们这帮大傻逼!
I'm the vice president of the United States, you stupid little fuckers!

405
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,960
应该是这些人来求我!
These people should be begging me!

406
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,590
这个门的高度应该减一半
That door should be half its height

407
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,470
这样来我办公室的人就得他娘的跪着了!
so that people can only approach me in my office on their goddamn, motherfucking knees.

408
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,660
我不能失去Doyle
I can't lose Doyle.

409
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:39,290
- 谁手里还有一把参议员? - 和Doyle划清界限吧 当他是在唬你
Who else has a bucketful of senators? Cut Doyle loose, all right? Call his bluff.

410
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:42,640
- 我们转换阵营去接触移民改革党团 - 什麽?
We reach across the aisle - to the immigration reform caucus. - What?

411
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,830
你想不想顺便摆脱大白人挑剔的形象 女士?
You want to break out the white, pointy hoods, too, ma'am?

412
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:47,050
听着 我们只要给他们党团几个承诺
Look, we throw them a few commitments to their cause

413
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,140
以此换取他们对革除"冗长辩论"的支持
in exchange for support on filibuster reform.

414
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,300
- 这很容易... - 呃
- This is easy. - Ugh.

415
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,810
你只要踏上了那条黑道 什麽幺蛾子都会有
Once you go down that dark country road, the lights go out and the scarecrows come to life.

416
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,550
有人想听班卓琴吗?
Yeah, anyone hear the banjo music?

417
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:59,060
听着 Mike 你老听那种音乐 是因爲你丫脑子被门板夹了
Look, Mike, that's what you always hear because mentally you're in a fuckin' hammock on a back porch.

418
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:02,460
- Dan 这可不是梦幻政坛 - 住口! 住口!
Dan, this isn't fantasy politics. Stop it! Stop it!

419
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,660
这对你来说既是参议院改革的胜利
This is a win for you on Senate reform

420
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:08,080
也是另一场对总统在移民政策上的胜利 对吧?
and it's also another big win for you with the president on immigration, all right?

421
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,570
大胜 大胜!
Win big, win big.

422
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,250
我不知道...也许你和Dan应该去和...
I don't know... maybe you and Dan should go down and talk to...

423
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:16,540
呃...我去...亚利桑那州参议员谈一谈
J... God damn it... the senator from Arizona.

424
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,240
就是那个想对穿披风的人随机搜查的那个
The one who wants to random search people in ponchos?

425
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,390
- 噢 Bill - O'Brien
- Oh, Bill. - O'Brien.

426
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,520
- 对 - 对
- Yeah. - Yeah.

427
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,420
他和那些白人至上党团老眉来眼去的
He's got a lot of sway with the pro-Caucasian caucus.

428
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,100
好吧 那我们有了O'Brien 他可以带来McCaulay和Cunliffe
All right, so we get O'Brien, who brings us McCaulay and Cunliffe.

429
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,660
McCaulay是那个鼻毛长得像 有浣熊住鼻孔里的那位麽?
Is McCaulay the one with the nose hair problem like he's got two raccoons in his nostrils?

430
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:35,010
那就是7票对Doyle的5票 那就是"冗长辩论"派的绝杀啊
That's seven to Doyle's five. I mean, this is a filibuster slam dunk.

431
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:37,030
- Chung在直播电视节目上 - 什麽?!
- Chung is on TV live. - What?!

432
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,500
- 快打开 快打开 - 遥控器呢?
- Get it on. Get it on. - Where's the remote?

433
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,480
在碗里 遥控器在碗里
It's in the bowl. The remote's in the bowl.

434
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,560
Sue 按按乐在哪里?
Sue, where's the clicker?

435
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:45,580
- 按按乐在哪里? - 同志们 在书柜里呢
- Where's the clicker? - Guys, it's in the credenza.

436
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,970
拿来 快 快 快
Get it. Quick, quick, quick.

437
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,840
- 什麽频道? 频道? - 直播的都行
- What channel? Channel? - Any live TV.

438
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,140
Mike...不 Mike 别碰那个遥控器 搞不好你要发射原子弹的
Mike... no, Mike. Don't touch that remote. You're gonna launch a nuke or something.

439
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:55,770
- Sue? - 这是关于今天早些时候评论所做的简单回应
- Sue? - A few brief words about the comments that were made earlier today.

440
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:59,510
尽管在互联网上有一些阴暗的流言
Despite what is said in some dark corners of the Internet,

441
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,880
但在我出生的时候
when I was born, both my parents

442
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,940
我的父母都是完全的归化美国公民
were fully naturalized American citizens.

443
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,110
什麽 他是他妈的美国队长吗?
What? He's Captain fuckin' America?

444
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:09,390
- 现在怎麽了? 干得好啊 Amy - 这不是...
- What's happening here? Good job, Amy. - It's not...

445
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:13,010
这不是Scott给我的信息
That is not the information I was given by Scott.

446
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,280
这说明了她手下职员调查技术的透彻性
A quiet word with one of her staff regarding the thoroughness of their research techniques.

447
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,850
到底Scott用的是什麽调查工具? 是他娘的苦力报告吗?
What did Scott use as a research tool, the fuckin' drudge report?

448
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,790
- 二代美籍华裔 - 那个加上卫生间的墙
Second-generation Chinese American... That and bathroom walls.

449
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,190
自豪到足以爲了这个国家抛头颅洒热血
Proud enough to risk my life for this country.

450
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,940
我胸前有一颗紫色的心
I've got a purple heart on my chest,

451
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,070
但在我胸腔里跳动的那颗 却是红白蓝色的
but the one that beats inside of me is red, white, and blue.

452
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:34,420
- 噢 不 他真说得出口 - 他抓住了机会
- No, he didn't. He didn't say that. - He is seizing his moment.

453
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,870
这也是爲什麽 这个国家是地球上最伟大的国家
And that's why this is the greatest country on earth.

454
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,630
我现在能吐出一条腿来
I am gonna throw up a leg.

455
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,290
然后我会捡起那条腿 用它打死Scott
And then I'm gonna take that leg and I'm gonna beat Scott to death with it.

456
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,670
- Scott! - 啊
- Scott! - Ah!

457
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:50,470
我会起草一封道歉信给明尼苏达之王 也就是Chung州长
I'm gonna go draft a letter of apology to the king of Minnesota, governor Chung.

458
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,060
现在我们要做的是 Mike 好好给Chung道歉
Here's what we're gonna do... Mike, big fat apology to Chung;

459
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,750
Amy 搞定Doyle 我要这一票
Amy, fuck Doyle. I want this bill.

460
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:01,890
你们去和O'Brien好好谈谈 拿下边境党团
You guys talk to O'Brien and get that border caucus.

461
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,620
- 好的 - Amy 穿上你的舞鞋 马上去边境
- Okay. - Amy, put on your dancing shoes and head for the border right now.

462
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:07,790
- 快去 - 不 我不去
- Go on. - No, I'm not doing it.

463
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,370
快点动起来
Get a move on.

464
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,370
- 他们来了 - 开始吧
This is them. Here we go.

465
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,660
你好 O'Brien参议员 我是Dan Egan 我们通过电话了 很高兴见到你 先生
Hi, senator O'Brien. I'm Dan Egan. We spoke on the phone. A pleasure to meet you, sir.

466
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,730
好吧 我不知道你是谁 所以我还不知道该不该高兴
Well, I have no idea who you are, so I don't know whether it's a pleasure or not.

467
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,240
- 好吧 - 这是Jack
- Okay. - This is Jack.

468
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,020
- 你好 Jack - 你好
- Hi, Jack. - Hi.

469
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,050
Amy Brookheimer 副总统的幕僚长
Amy Brookheimer, vice president's chief of staff.

470
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:34,100
长官? 应该是女长官吧?
Chief? Shouldn't that be chiefess?

471
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,030
别紧张 小姐 我只是开玩笑
Relax, missy. I'm just yanking your chain.

472
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,220
当然了
Absolutely.

473
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,330
这地方不错 不是吗?
This place looks nice, huh?

474
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,160
这里的牛小排好像很不错 但在我们点菜之前
Looks like they do a mighty fine plate of ribs, but before we do any ordering,

475
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,920
我想知道你们会不会说一些琐碎的事来扫兴
I'd like to know if you're going to offend us

476
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,570
如果是这样 我们就不用吃东西 直接走了
with some chickenshit deal that means we have to leave before the food comes.

477
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,670
尽管点菜吧
You're fine to order.

478
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,330
我感觉糟透了
I feel so horrible.

479
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,220
你知道吗 就像我下令解决某人
You know, it's like I've ordered a hit on somebody.

480
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,800
而现在只能等他们打电话告诉我任务完成了
I'm just waiting for the call to say that it's done.

481
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,700
任务完成
It's done.

482
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,090
你想来杯酒吗? 或者喝杯水? 或者...洗手液?
Do you want a glass of wine? You want some water? You want some hand sanitiz...

483
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,520
- 我需要安静 - 安静
- I want quiet. - Quiet?

484
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,280
再见 Scott 你的职业生涯到头了
So long, Scott. You are professionally dead.

485
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,670
祝你今晚愉快
Have a nice evening.

486
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,390
在上东区
Up here on the eastern seaboard,

487
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,710
人们很容易忘记 我们国家有很大一块地方
it's easy to forget what a big slice of our country rubs shoulders

488
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:28,180
还和一个名叫墨西哥的失败国家有来往
with a failed state by the name of Mexico.

489
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,850
听着 如果你有个糟糕的邻居 每晚都跑到你的院子里
Now, if you had bad neighbors who came into your yard every night

490
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:38,740
弄一些药和豆子在你的花上面
to crap a buttful of drugs and beans on your flowers,

491
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,420
你应该会考虑建一个围栏
you might think about building a fence.

492
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,080
我们不可能建边境围栏 好吗?
You're not gonna get a border fence, all right?

493
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,180
那可是一条3000英里长的围栏
You're talking about a 3,000-mile-long fence.

494
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,400
对建筑业来说是好事啊
Great for the construction industry.

495
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,410
是啊 但讽刺的是 我们只请得起移民工人来做这个
Yeah, but ironically, the only affordable option would be immigrant labor.

496
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,200
嗯 我的选民已经厌倦了
Well, my constituents are fed up

497
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,910
在自己的国家却感到寡不敌衆
with feeling outnumbered in their own country.

498
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,720
伙计们 在保持美国的特性这个问题上
Fellas, we shouldn't have a problem

499
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,260
我们不该有什麽问题
working to preserve a certain kind of American identity.

500
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,110
是啊
Yes.

501
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,180
亲爱的 如果你继续这麽说 晚餐结束以后我们还能一起抽雪茄
Now you keep talking like that, sweetheart, and we'll be having cigars at the end of this dinner.

502
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,640
只要不是古巴的就行
Just not Cuban ones.

503
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,130
天哪
Oh, my God,

504
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:20,390
- 今天真是糟透了 - 是吗?
- I am having the shittiest day. - Yeah?

505
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,860
- 有什麽能让我高兴的吗? - 确实有
You got anything to make me feel better? I do indeed.

506
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,390
- 什麽? - 嗯...
- What is it? - Well...

507
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,780
大概7英吋长 在我两腿之间...
It's about seven inches, hangs between my legs...

508
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:34,230
- 那玩意 - 我喜欢叫他Ted士官
The thing. I like to call him sergeant Ted.

509
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:37,280
好吧 你告诉Ted士官
Okay, well, you tell sergeant Ted

510
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,980
我希望他可以
I would like him very much

511
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,570
在我的椭圆办公室里训练我
to drill me in my oval office.

512
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,820
事实上 我希望他
In fact, I need him to put the finger

513
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,530
把手指放在扣子上
on the button

514
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,820
然后到我的玫瑰园里来
and come into my rose garden.

515
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,390
士官已经立正了
The sergeant is standing at attention.

516
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,250
你知道吗 我现在就过去 马上
You know what... I'm coming over there, like, right away.

517
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,430
呃 你来的时候能偷偷溜进来吗?
Uh, you know, when you come over, can you try and sneak in incognito?

518
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,590
我的韩国邻居不会乐意看到我和你约会的
I got Korean neighbors and I don't think they'd like the idea of me dating you.

519
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:09,570
这是玩笑还是什麽? 一点都不好笑 闭嘴 Ted
Is that some kind of a joke or something? It's not funny at all. Fuck off, Ted.

520
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:11,060
我不懂你爲什麽要说...
I mean, I don't know why you would s...

521
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,200
- 你在...你在打电话吗? - 嗯哼
- You were... you were on the phone? - Mm-hmm.

522
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,000
- 我什麽都没听到 - 你最好什麽都没听到
- Oh, I didn't hear anything. - You better not have heard anything.

523
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,400
我什麽都没说
I didn't say anything.

524
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,270
天哪
Oh, my God.

525
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:27,660
真他妈的... 嘿 Jonah
Oh, for fuck sakes. Hey, Jonah.

526
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,410
- 你的紧身短裤呢? - 噢 紧身短裤会産生一些负面的牵引
What happened to your hot pants? Oh, the hot pants picked up some negative traction.

527
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,690
我觉得它不适合在办公室穿
I realize now they're unbecoming of my office.

528
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,630
我只是来看看和Chung州长直接的误会解除没
I'm just coming in to see if the misunderstanding with governor Chung has been resolved.

529
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,290
是啊 一切都好 好极了 好得不能再好了

很好 那我回去继续享受周日了
Excellent. Well, then, I'm gonna go enjoy what's left of my Sunday.

我正在看约翰格里森姆的新书 太棒了 你也应该看看
I got the latest Grisham on the go and it's just awesome. You should read...

532
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,630
在提出财政申请的同时
As well as the funding request,

533
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,330
我们还能保证 副总统会反对
we can offer a commitment that the vice president will oppose immunity

534
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:55,740
对居留期超过五年的非法移民的豁免
for any illegal immigrants who have been here for more than five years.

535
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,860
嗯 现在这样才比较合我们心意
Well, now you're singing a tune that we may dance to.

536
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,840
- 我们只是... - 她还会游说总统
- Well, we just... - And she will lobby the president

537
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,330
并且公开表示支持你的立场
and express public support for your position.

538
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,440
好了 我回家了 我要回去大干一场
All right, I'm going home. I'm getting fucked every which way.

539
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,870
- Sue 总统来过电话吗? - 没
- Sue, did the president call? - No.

540
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,390
如果你能够履行这些 我会用爱我的傻儿子的热情
If you can deliver that, I will appear to love filibuster reform

541
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:21,550
去支持革除"冗长辩论"
as much as I appear to love my idiot son.

542
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:23,180
而看在我老婆的份上
And for my wife's sake,

543
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,630
我看起来像是爱极了那个可怜的白痴
I appear to love that wretched shitnia lot.

544
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,200
晚安 走吧 Jack
Good night. Let's go, Jack.

545
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,530
很高兴你们终于学会了...妥协
Good to see you guys could learn a new word today... compromise.

546
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,620
怎麽样? 咱们各让一步?
What do you say? Meet me halfway?

547
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:47,830
我今晚肯定睡不着了 太黑暗了
I'm not gonna be able to sleep tonight. That was fuckin' dark.

548
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:51,550
- 你比我估计的还多上了10层 - 这样一来 我就得下100层了
You've gone up 10 levels in my estimation, by the way. Which means I've gone down 100 in my own.

549
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,640
有时候爲了上升 你必须先下降
Sometimes you've gotta go down to go up.

550
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:57,790
喂 这次是我功劳
Eh... I am taking the credit for this.

551
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,290
是我打通了这条路 得到了这份肮脏的荣誉 所以由我来告诉Selina这个好消息
I tunneled through the shit, I get the dirty glory. It is me who tells Selina the good news.

552
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:09,560
- 副总统呢? - 回家了
Where is the vice president? She has gone home for the evening.

553
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:13,440
- 爲什麽? - 关于"大干一场"吧
Why? Something about "getting fucked every which way."

554
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,610
- 直接引用她的话 - 天哪 是的 我听到她讲电话了
Direct quote. Oh, God, yeah. I heard something on the phone.

555
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:21,210
- 天哪 天哪 - 她能承受多少次啊?
Oh, God. Oh, God. How many times can she be underneath that?

556
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:24,410
她的身体这麽小 而那男人好像很大
She's got such a little body and he seemed like a big man.

557
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:28,150
- 谁 他是谁? - 喂喂喂 能不能聊点别的?
Who? Who's he? Hey, hey, somebody talk about something else?

558
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:30,070
- 什麽都行 - 我得想点别的
Anything. Yeah, I gotta get these images out of my head.

559
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,220
我们能聊聊...我不知道...
Can we talk about... I don't know...

560
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,490
- 最喜欢的乐队 或者别的什麽 行吗? - 好啊 Mike 除了老鹰乐队你还喜欢什麽?
our favorite band or something, please? Yes. Who else are you into, Mike, apart from the Eagles?

561
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,970
呃 伟大的死亡(著名美国摇滚乐队)
Uh, grateful dead.

562
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:38,990
噢 那也是你最喜欢的妓院的名字 不是吗?
Oh, that's the name of your favorite whorehouse, too, right?

563
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:42,000
呃 等不及回家去烧掉这身衣服了
Ugh, can't wait to get home and burn my clothes.

564
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,150
别他妈把衣服弄坏了 Mike
Don't fuck up that suit, Mike.

565
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,910
- 好吧 晚安 Sue - 晚安 Gary

Good night, Dan. Jesus Christ.

567
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,740
Dan 我给你十秒钟 别再让我分心了
Dan, you have about 10 seconds to stop distracting me,

568
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,370
不然他们就会在沙发后面发现你的尸体
or the next thing that they'll find at the back of that couch are your remains.

569
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:02,120
如果你不介意 我可以去副总统办公室里头坐着
If you like, I can go sit in the vice president's office.

570
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,570
什麽?
Excuse me?

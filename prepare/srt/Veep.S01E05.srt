1
00:00:10,206 --> 00:00:11,973
民主是个好东西
You know, democracy is fantastic,

2
00:00:11,974 --> 00:00:14,208
不过这玩意也太蠢了吧
but it is also fucking dull.

3
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:15,476
他们一点要分胜负的意思都没有
It doesn't even look like they're gonna break a tie.

4
00:00:15,477 --> 00:00:17,177
Selina根本就不用来
Selina does not even have to be here.

5
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:20,114
苍天啊 她是不是要睡着了?
Oh, my God. Is she falling asleep?

6
00:00:20,115 --> 00:00:22,516
不 她不能在电视直播的时候睡着
No, she cannot fall asleep on live TV.

7
00:00:22,517 --> 00:00:25,252
不能在C-SPAN啊(政论直播台) 这样讽刺性太高了
Not on C-SPAN. The irony would be too huge.

8
00:00:25,253 --> 00:00:26,719
别啊 别啊
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,988
你这是在挥手么? 她可不能望穿电视看到你哦
Are you really waving? She cannot see you through the TV.

10
00:00:28,989 --> 00:00:30,289
一般人四岁左右就明白这个道理了
Most of us learn that when we're four.

11
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,023
我们可以打电话给她 振动会震醒她的
We can call her. The vibrations will wake her up.

12
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:33,991
不行 她没有睡着
No, she's not gonna fall asleep.

13
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,960
说不定只有我们注意到了这个事
It's probably just us who have noticed.

14
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:38,329
不是的 Clive 没有
No, Clive, no.

15
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,398
她没睡着
She is not falling asleep.

16
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,567
没有 只是那里很暖和而已
No, it is just very warm down there.

17
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:44,602
哇 头顿了一下 刚才她顿了一下 好啦
- Whoa, head jerk. Just head jerked. - Okay.

18
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,650
你确定订的是今天早上八点么?
You sure you set this meeting for 8:00 a.m. Today?

19
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,520
我确定吗?
Am I sure?

20
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,856
好吧 我错了 你当然确定啦
Okay, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Okay, of course you did.

21
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,592
必须的 请不要这样盯着我了
Of course. Please, stop staring at me like that.

22
00:01:07,593 --> 00:01:11,029
用眼神剥光我的感觉 我是用眼神给你多穿点 Mike
- Undressing me with your eyes. - I'm adding more clothes, Mike.

23
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,264
绿色产业的火箭已经差不多到时候升空了 对吧?
Clean jobs almost ready for liftoff, right?

24
00:01:13,265 --> 00:01:14,965
虽然细节上还需要一些打磨 不过是的
A little more detail work, but yes.

25
00:01:14,966 --> 00:01:16,767
我觉得我们已经可以开始倒数了
I do think that we can start the countdown.

26
00:01:16,768 --> 00:01:18,568
好的 那你穿好宇航服吧
Okay, well, get your spacesuits on.

27
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,804
说到宇航服
You know, speaking of spacesuits,

28
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:23,105
我在一个签书会上该遇到过Buzz Aldrin (著名宇航员 登月第二人 )
I met Buzz Aldrin at a book signing.

29
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:24,340
你知道他们宇航员最怕什么吗?
You know what really freaks those guys out?

30
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:28,043
在24小时之内连看17遍日出 好吧
Seeing 17 dawns in a matter of 24 hours. Okay.

31
00:01:28,044 --> 00:01:30,245
早上好 早上好 女士
- Good morning. - Morning, ma'am.

32
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:31,612
我今天是什么日程 Sue?
How is my day looking, Sue?

33
00:01:31,613 --> 00:01:35,483
你下午要去参加一个社区大学见面会
You have one community college meeting this afternoon.

34
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:38,619
这就没了? 是的
is that it? - Yes.

35
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,221
不 不 不 这样不对
No, no, no, no. That's not right.

36
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:43,157
好吧 等一分钟 如果你往下滚屏呢?
Uh, okay, wait a minute. What happens if you scroll down?

37
00:01:45,526 --> 00:01:51,131
那要是往上滚呢? 那已经过去了 女士
- How about if you scroll up? - That's the past, ma'am.

38
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:55,502
他在这里干什么? Mike是你八点钟的议程
- What's he for? - Mike's your 8:00.

39
00:01:55,503 --> 00:01:59,139
我们要讨论一下今晚你在消防员协会上的致辞
We're talking about your speech for the firefighter's association tonight.

40
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,774
Dan去哪了? 我找了他一早上了
- Hey, where is Dan? - I have been trying him all morning.

41
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:08,647
给我留了语音邮箱 呼喊他的名字
Left him a voicemail. Called him a name.

42
00:02:08,648 --> 00:02:10,481
就是我们平常干的那样
- Just a little thing we do. - Mike!

43
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:13,551
我觉得吧 咱们应该开场讲个笑话
So here's what I'm thinking. We need to open with a funny joke.

44
00:02:13,552 --> 00:02:15,452
开门见山
Solid narrative throughout it,

45
00:02:15,453 --> 00:02:18,256
带到我真正想说的话题上 类似五佳吐槽那种级别的
into which I would like to pepper, like, five zingers.

46
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:21,225
没问题 我这里有几个金点子 好的
No problemo. McClintock gold. - Okay. Good.

47
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,462
我觉得开场我们可以稍微自嘲一下
I thought for the opener we'd do a little self-deprecating joke

48
00:02:23,463 --> 00:02:25,197
说说在参议会上睡着了的事 不要
about your snooze in The Senate. - No.

49
00:02:25,198 --> 00:02:28,000
不想听一下吗? 不想
want to hear it? - No.

50
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,268
好吧 没关系
Okay. Yeah, it doesn't matter.

51
00:02:29,269 --> 00:02:30,769
这个是你第一个笑点
Okay, here you go, first home run.

52
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:33,672
消防员对他们的工作都很有热情
Firefighters have a passion for their work.

53
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:35,875
而纵火犯们则热爱点东西玩
Arsonists just have a burning desire.

54
00:02:37,911 --> 00:02:39,211
你这个是笑话吗?
Is that even a joke?

55
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:41,080
是啊 这用了文字游戏或者是戏仿一类的手法
Yeah, it's a word play or a parody.

56
00:02:41,081 --> 00:02:43,316
嗯... 好吧 没关系
- Mmm. - Okay, doesn't matter.

57
00:02:43,317 --> 00:02:44,817
还有一个 好吧
got another one. - All right.

58
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:47,387
梯子在消防事业中显然是很重要的
Ladders, obviously germane to the firefighting business.

59
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,356
你就说消防员们总是在爬梯子
You go, firefighters are always climbing ladders

60
00:02:50,357 --> 00:02:52,325
而政客们都...
and in politics you're always...

61
00:02:52,326 --> 00:02:54,861
这个...我没认出来我写的是啥 但这个基本意思是说
and this, I don't even know what I wrote, but it's basically

62
00:02:54,862 --> 00:02:57,264
你们是去一个什么地方来着...
you're taking steps to

63
00:02:57,265 --> 00:03:00,134
不用梯子
get somewhere but without a ladder...

64
00:03:00,135 --> 00:03:02,468
好吧 这个我一点也笑不出来
Yeah, this is not making me laugh at all.

65
00:03:02,469 --> 00:03:03,937
那这个等成熟了再给你说
We'll bring that one back when it's ready.

66
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:06,172
好了 有天消防安全员问我...
Okay, fire safety guy asked me the other day,

67
00:03:06,173 --> 00:03:08,409
然后你就换成自己的语气 我在床上抽烟吗?
and this is your voice... do I smoke in bed?

68
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,345
然后我就说 我从来都没什么好抱怨的
And I said, 'I've never had any complaints.'

69
00:03:13,448 --> 00:03:15,015
口味太重了? 太重了?
Too shock? Too shock?

70
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:17,084
好吧 这还有一个半成品的想法
Okay, this is kind of a half an idea.

71
00:03:17,085 --> 00:03:19,719
这个情景是如果你是一位消防员
All right, so the idea is if you're a fireman

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,822
要把湿毯子铺到什么东西上...
putting a wet blanket on something...

73
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:24,491
你迟到了 是的 而且我非常非常抱歉
- You are late. - Yes, and I am incredibly sorry.

74
00:03:24,492 --> 00:03:27,794
我昨晚不是在家睡的 我就是...睡过头了
I was not in my own apartment last night. I just... I overslept.

75
00:03:27,795 --> 00:03:31,131
好吧 迟到之后说你中风什么的还行
Okay, having a massive stroke is an excuse for coming in late to this office.

76
00:03:31,132 --> 00:03:32,599
说你性福了是绝对不行的 Dan
Having sex is absolutely not, Dan.

77
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,401
说得对 女士 但是吧…
Quite right, ma'am. Although, in my defense,

78
00:03:34,402 --> 00:03:36,804
我还以为你不在办公室 为什么?
- I didn't even think you'd be here. - Why?

79
00:03:36,805 --> 00:03:40,140
呃 在白宫有一场关于财政责任提案的简报
Well, there's the briefing on the fiscal responsibility bill at the White House.

80
00:03:40,141 --> 00:03:41,575
我以为你会在那边
I just assumed you'd be there.

81
00:03:41,576 --> 00:03:43,577
他们没有邀请我 什么?!
I wasn't invited. What?

82
00:03:43,578 --> 00:03:45,745
这个什么... 就现在
this is happening... - Right now.

83
00:03:45,746 --> 00:03:47,114
去她娘的总统!
Fuck that potus.

84
00:03:47,115 --> 00:03:49,817
他两周前国防预算简报的时候就没有邀请我
He did this with the defense budget briefing two weeks ago.

85
00:03:49,818 --> 00:03:52,219
天哪 Amy在哪?
God. Where is Amy?

86
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,188
你戴着一个堵嘴的...
- You get a gag on top of... - Mike!

87
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,891
为什么我不知道这件事?!
Why didn't I know about this?!

88
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,963
我一定要去 他们不能把我晾在外面
I'm going. They can't keep me out of there.

89
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,138
女士 我在这里呢 你需要什么东西吗?
Hey, ma'am, I'm right here. Can I get you something?

90
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:12,307
你有旱冰鞋吗?
You got rollerblades?

91
00:04:15,578 --> 00:04:17,779
我来了
I'm coming in.

92
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:27,156
好了
Okay.

93
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:28,691
很好
Good.

94
00:04:32,963 --> 00:04:34,697
同志们好
Hi, guys.

95
00:04:36,366 --> 00:04:39,034
财政责任 这太扯了
- Fiscal responsibility. - It's ridiculous.

96
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,003
你玩我呢吧? 这些人
Are you kidding me? Not one of those guys

97
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,238
都十年没自己出过午饭钱了吧 (讽刺各种工作餐)
has paid for their own lunch in like a decade.

98
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:46,074
我觉得我出席了就很表明态度
I think I made a big point by being there.

99
00:04:46,075 --> 00:04:48,543
非常啊 不过我喘气声有点大
- Big point. - I was breathing really heavily, though.

100
00:04:48,544 --> 00:04:50,778
不会有人注意的吧
You don't think anyone noticed that, do you?

101
00:04:50,779 --> 00:04:52,480
Bob Lewis还有肺气肿呢
Bob Lewis has got emphysema.

102
00:04:52,481 --> 00:04:54,315
听起来跟鼓风机一个效果
Sounds like a broken-down leaf blower.

103
00:04:54,316 --> 00:04:56,551
确实是
He does.

104
00:04:56,552 --> 00:04:59,020
这个确实是他给人的神奇印象
That is an actually uncanny impression of him.

105
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,554
副总统女士 怎么了?
Madam Vice President. - Yeah?

106
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,189
噢 嗨 Jonah 嘿 Jonah
- Oh, hi, Jonah. - Hey, Jonah.

107
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,824
你是来找我们的吗? 噢 不是的
- You coming to see us? - Oh, no.

108
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:05,293
我得请一个小时事假
I had to take a personal hour.

109
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:07,095
我和营养师有预约
I have a nutritionist appointment.

110
00:05:07,096 --> 00:05:10,031
噢 你没事吧 会好起来的
- Oh, hope you're okay. - It'll be fine.

111
00:05:10,032 --> 00:05:12,067
我是果糖不耐受
I'm fructose intolerant.

112
00:05:12,068 --> 00:05:13,969
果糖? 就是水果里的糖分
Fructose? - Fruit sugars.

113
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,038
这很罕见 噢
- It's very rare. - Oh.

114
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,773
那祝你好运吧
Well, good luck with all that.

115
00:05:17,774 --> 00:05:20,343
谢谢
Thank you.

116
00:05:20,344 --> 00:05:23,246
你还以为他已经怪到最巅峰了
Just when you thought he couldn't get any weirder,

117
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:25,583
丫就怪上一层楼给你看 天哪
he did. - my God.

118
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,289
之前的事很抱歉 我以为你还在位子上呢
Oh, uh, sorry about earlier.

119
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,857
好吧 我现在要全体开会
I thought you were in the chair.

120
00:05:32,858 --> 00:05:35,559
好的 你知道吗？ 我需要和每个人开个会议
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna need a meeting with everybody.

121
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,762
我要一杯咖啡
I need a coffee.

122
00:05:37,763 --> 00:05:39,564
现在的问题是
Here's the deal.

123
00:05:39,565 --> 00:05:42,166
总统在躲我
The President is avoiding me.

124
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,834
说不定他就是犯病呢 就跟Gary的脚一样
Maybe he's just flakey like Gary's feet.

125
00:05:43,835 --> 00:05:46,136
不是的 我了解他 他很讨厌正面冲突
No, I know him. He hates confrontation,

126
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,672
显然现在就是他有什么要和我冲突的事了
and obviously there is something that he needs to confront me about.

127
00:05:48,673 --> 00:05:52,742
那他还会明确地支持我的绿色产业提案么?
I mean, am I still getting unequivocal support on clean jobs?

128
00:05:52,743 --> 00:05:56,413
这上面我需要白宫的可靠消息
I need some good, solid White House intel on this.

129
00:05:56,414 --> 00:05:57,648
好的 白奸 对
- Yup, the whitegeist. - Right.

130
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:58,882
我来搞定 很好
- I'm on it. - Good.

131
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:01,218
好的 去吧 去吧 好的 好的
- Okay, please, please. - Okay. Okay.

132
00:06:01,219 --> 00:06:04,056
我要看看今晚消防协会的这个事
I'm gonna check and see if this fireman thing tonight

133
00:06:04,057 --> 00:06:05,290
都有哪报道了
is getting mentioned anywhere.

134
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,492
哇 你这是要自搜么? 是的
- Whoa, are you self-googling? - Yeah.

135
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:09,461
我们办公室里有人负责这个的啊 女士
We have guys in the office to do that, ma'am.

136
00:06:09,462 --> 00:06:12,030
换我的话就不会搜索你的名字绰号什么的
I wouldn't search on your name or your nicknames, really.

137
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:15,801
我的绰号? Gary 我的绰号是什么?
My nicknames? Gary, what are my nicknames?

138
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,906
就是一些我们去搜博客的时候
There's just some nicknames that it's necessary

139
00:06:20,907 --> 00:06:24,542
用到的小爱称而已
for us to search on to kind of pick up on blog coverage.

140
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:27,445
但是我的意思是 都有什么绰号? 呃 好吧
- But, I mean, like what? - Uh, okay.

141
00:06:27,446 --> 00:06:31,282
有一个是和你支持法案相关的
There's one that has to do with the legislation you did

142
00:06:31,283 --> 00:06:33,017
在公共场合母乳喂养
to support women breast feeding in public.

286
00:12:57,336 --> 00:13:01,272
你知道吗 我让Dan和Mike扮演了反对提案的恶魔
You know, I've asked Dan and Mike to play devil's advocate

287
00:13:01,273 --> 00:13:03,008
模拟了一些争议
against this bill, assemble some arguments.

288
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,776

You know, what people might say against it and stuff.

Dan很适合
Dan is a great choice.

290
00:13:06,612 --> 00:13:09,180
他已经是恶魔代言人了

如果他近期还不能解决好经济问题的话

航天局就得给他造个逃生舱了

294
00:13:15,487 --> 00:13:17,622
他怎么能搞成这样的?
I mean, how has he let this happen?

295
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:19,957
天哪 如果我是... 嗯 嗯

311
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:53,588
你知道的 我是石油界出身的 但是这不意味着
You know, I am from oil, but that doesn't mean that I don't care deeply

312
00:13:53,589 --> 00:13:56,625
我就不关心我孩子的将来 孩子们当然还是有未来的
about my children's future and, of course, their children's future.

我得说 你有边缘性人格障碍
And I should tell you, I think you're borderline developmentally disabled.

这项议案就他妈是个奇耻大辱
This bill is a fucking disgrace

像个臭婊子一样被吞进木片机里绞得粉碎

Selina Meyer为了让自己高枕无忧

谁会是最终的受害者?
Who will suffer when these companies are no longer competitive

348
00:15:28,122 --> 00:15:31,058

这是冷血 阴险的 阶级迫害

再也不会有人想给自己的孩子起这个名字
No one will want to call their child by that name.

如今已经没人叫阿道夫了 很快也再不会有人叫Selina

我的核心看法是 我没怎么看懂
My chief criticism is that I don't fully understand it.

没错 好的 我会砍了儿童这条

怎么了? 能有什么事啊
What is? It could be a lot of things.

380

总统急于通过财政责任法案
The President is very eager to get the fiscal responsibility bill through.

381
00:16:58,411 --> 00:17:02,014
非常迫切以至于... 妈的 不是吧
- So eager that... - Oh, shit, no.

382
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:04,149
他希望集全力于这项议案
He wants all focus to be on that bill.

383
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:06,084
因而搁置了其余五项提案
He's dropped five other pieces of legislation.

384
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,486
不 绿色产业恰在其中
No. - clean jobs is one of them.

385
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:10,921

总统他他妈的就是个气死人的狗杂种
That president, he is a suffocating son of a bitch.

389
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,234

It's okay.

390
00:17:24,235 --> 00:17:27,471
之前怎么一点消息都没有?
Had we not heard anything about this?

391
00:17:27,472 --> 00:17:31,108
博客上先前确实有些动作
Apparently there were rumblings in the blogs.

392
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:32,743
我们为什么没看到?
Why weren't we on it?

393
00:17:32,744 --> 00:17:35,145
他们用的是绰号 所以我们才没搜到
They used a nickname, ma'am, and we were not searching on it.

394

什么绰号? 不明Meyer女士
Which one? - Mrs. DoubtMeyer.

395
00:17:37,448 --> 00:17:39,850
从没听你提过啊
Well, you never mentioned that one.

396
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,086
这说明您有那么点儿小困惑
Yeah, that means you're kind of slightly confused.

397
00:17:42,087 --> 00:17:44,221
还有些男子气概
You're oddly masculine.

398
00:17:44,222 --> 00:17:47,024
真够恶毒的
It's a shitty nickname.

399
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,994
听着 我接受不了
Well, I'm just not gonna accept this.

400
00:17:49,995 --> 00:17:52,697
噢 天呐 要是我参加了那些弱智的 环特区Segway之旅
Oh, my God. I'd have more power in my hands

401
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,833
没准就能拥有更多权力了
if I joined one of those moronic Segway tours of D.C.

402
00:17:55,834 --> 00:18:01,005
你们知道这对我造成了多大损失吗
I mean, do you have any idea what I have lost here today?

403
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:03,908
知道吗 嗯?
Do you? Really?

404
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:07,144
不说话是吧?
Are you not gonna say anything?

405
00:18:07,145 --> 00:18:08,945
天呐!
Jesus!

406
00:18:08,946 --> 00:18:11,448
Dan 你男朋友知道这回事儿么?
Dan, did your boyfriend know anything about this?

407
00:18:11,449 --> 00:18:13,483
我有努力利用Jonah获取情报
I was trying to use Jonah for intelligence.

408
00:18:13,484 --> 00:18:16,252
这就跟拿羊角包
That's like trying to use a croissant

409
00:18:16,253 --> 00:18:18,521
当假阳具一样 我以为...
as a fucking dildo. - I thought...

410
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,156
省省吧 说白了就是
No, no, no. Let me be more clear.

411
00:18:20,157 --> 00:18:25,529
偷鸡不成蚀把米!
It doesn't do the job and it makes a fucking mess!

412
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,097
请出去
Get out of my office.

413
00:18:30,335 --> 00:18:32,236
Gary! 是 女士?

414
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:34,505
我需要点什么 好的 是什么特殊的东西吗
- I need something. - Okay, is there anything specific?

415
00:18:34,506 --> 00:18:36,373
我他妈不知道 我就是需要点什么
I don't fucking know. I just need something.

416
00:18:36,374 --> 00:18:38,242
你知道我打算做什么吗
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

417
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:40,344
我这就打电话给那个傻逼总统
I'm gonna call that stupid potus myself.

418
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:42,389
不开玩笑 我要让他收回他的狗屁决定
Seriously, I'm gonna tell him to shove it up his ass.

419
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:43,514
我觉得他没有任何理由...
I don't see any reason...

420
00:18:43,515 --> 00:18:44,948
女士 我们先静观其变 好吗
Ma'am, why don't we just wait this out, okay?

421
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:46,149
先静观其变?
Why don't we just wait this out?

422
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:48,117
这就是你的建议?
Is that what you're gonna suggest?

423
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:50,653
要是跟你一块儿困在着火的楼里我就完了 Mike
Remind me never to get trapped inside a burning building with you, Mike.

424
00:18:50,654 --> 00:18:52,821
我很擅长应对火灾 女士 打扰一下
- I'm very good in a fire. - Ma'am, if I may.

425
00:18:52,822 --> 00:18:56,091
我有个主意 我们不如去找一位友善的参议员
I think I have an idea. What if we went to a friendly senator

426
00:18:56,092 --> 00:18:59,294
提议由他将绿色产业中的主要内容...
and suggested that he or she take the best parts of clean jobs...

427
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:02,297
污染制造者制裁...环保企业税赋减免...
the sanctions on polluters, tax breaks for the good guys...

428
00:19:02,298 --> 00:19:04,166
作为财政责任法案的
then added that as an amendment

429
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,702
修正案添加进去?
to the fiscal responsibility bill?

430
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,309
这样一来 就相当于通过了绿色产业 不是吗?
Well, that would get the meat of clean jobs through, wouldn't it?

431
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,577
但是这会忤逆总统的意愿
It would also mean we'd go against the President's wishes.

432
00:19:15,578 --> 00:19:17,846
这是挑衅 女士 是啊
- That's provocative, ma'am. - Yeah.

433
00:19:17,847 --> 00:19:20,015
我正想找人挑衅呢
Well, I feel like provoking someone.

434
00:19:20,016 --> 00:19:21,750
真心的 Mike
I really do, Mike.

435
00:19:21,751 --> 00:19:25,453
我全身上下都是挑衅因子
I'm feeling very fucking provocative.

436
00:19:25,454 --> 00:19:27,055
我发现了 女士
I'm aware of that, ma'am.

437
00:19:27,056 --> 00:19:30,558
总统不会高兴的 我现在就敢断言
The President won't like that. I can tell you that right now.

438
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,127
这是个陷阱 我知道 你说得对
- This is the bear trap. - I know, you're right.

439
00:19:33,128 --> 00:19:35,095
我们不能这么做 是不是? 我们不能
We can't do this. Can we? We can't.

440
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,199
只要我们想有什么不能做的
We can do anything we want if we really want to.

441
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,535
你当这是拍电影呢? 美食 祈祷和恋爱?
What is this? Eat, Pray, fucking Love?

442
00:19:40,536 --> 00:19:42,804
听我解释 我不能
- Give me a minute. - I can't be seen

443
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:45,540
背着总统偷偷干涉立法
sneaking through legislation behind the President's back.

444
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:48,610
太疯狂了 会被视作背叛
I mean, that would be insane. It would be disloyal.

445
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:51,580
女士 Macauley议员很欣赏这项法案 他会同意我们的做法
Ma'am, Senator Macauley loves this bill and he may decide to do it anyway.

446
00:19:51,581 --> 00:19:54,684
听着 如果Macauley议员自愿这么做
Well, if Senator Macauley wants to do it himself,

447
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:56,152
那就万事大吉 明白吗
then that's great, you know?

448
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,421
但是我不能被人知道干这事儿
It's just that I can't be seen doing it.

449
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:00,589
明白了吗
Okay? Okay?

450
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,491
女士 我给您买了点儿冰淇淋
Ma'am, I got you a little bit of ice cream.

451
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,726
我想你可能需要这个
I thought that might be just what you wanted.

452
00:20:03,727 --> 00:20:05,794
正合我意
That is just exactly what I wanted.

453
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:09,130
能弄点儿生奶油来么? 当然 给我一分钟
- Would you get me some whipped cream? - Yeah, give me a minute.

454
00:20:10,199 --> 00:20:12,200
我想告诉你 但是我不能
I wanted to tell you, but I couldn't

455
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,835
不知道你明白没
because I didn't know if you already knew,

456
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,403
我忠于总统
but my loyalty is with potus.

457
00:20:15,404 --> 00:20:17,772
狗屁 你根本不知道他会反口绿色产业
Bullshit. You didn't know he was gonna roll over on clean jobs.

458
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:21,209
你屁都不知道 Dan 我知道
- You had no fucking idea. - Dan, I had a fucking idea.

459
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,979
你猜怎么着 Jonah? 我们以后不要见面了
You know what, Jonah? I don't think that we should see each other anymore.

460
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,015
别这样 对不起
come on. - Sorry.

461
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:29,119
你的意思是 就因为我跟总统
So you're saying that just because I'm not as close

462
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,121
没有你想的那么亲近
to potus as you thought I was,

463
00:20:31,122 --> 00:20:32,823
我们就不能在一起了?
that means that we can't hang out anymore?

464
00:20:32,824 --> 00:20:34,591
我的意思是 大猩猩同志
What I'm saying, you fucking ape,

465
00:20:34,592 --> 00:20:38,829
你他妈就是个彻头彻尾的废物
is that you are a useless waste of fucking carbon.

466
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:41,065
我本来还想利用你一下
I've been trying to cynically use you,

467
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:44,268
结果你他妈连点利用价值的没有
but you're so fucking low-rent, you can't even be exploited.

468
00:20:44,269 --> 00:20:48,705
还有 上菜上这么大份的餐厅
Not to mention the fact any restaurant that serves anything in a fuckload

469
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,207
绝对算不上什么好地方
is not a nice restaurant.

470
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,741
刚才的面包是狗吃了啊 混蛋?
Where is the bread at this place, asshole?

471
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:54,744
你 你这个纽约郊区的傻逼... 瞧瞧啊
- And you, you upstate New York dickshit... - Watch it.

472
00:20:54,745 --> 00:20:56,246
怎么了 老子说的就是纽约郊区
Yeah, I'll talk about upstate New York.

473
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,949
你们他妈的还当自己是纽约人 你们压根儿不是
You guys think you're fucking New York, but you're not.

474
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,551
瞧瞧你邋里邋遢满脸胡茬
And you with your perpetual 5:00 shadow,

475
00:21:01,552 --> 00:21:03,086
我根本不想和你在一起
you're not that great to be around.

476
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:04,821
我讨厌你 Dan
I don't like you, Dan.

477
00:21:04,822 --> 00:21:07,724
是吗 我倒觉得你有点儿喜欢我 Jonah
Really? I think you do. I think you're a little sweet on me, Jonah.

478
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,059
所以你才会这么生气
That's why you're so upset.

479
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,027
你知道么 Dan?
You know what, Dan?

480
00:21:11,028 --> 00:21:14,164
你他妈就是根老二
You're a fucking dick.

481
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,234
晚上睡觉的时候当心点儿 混蛋
Well, careful when you go to sleep tonight, asshole.

482
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,236
没准我会带着一大包橘子
Maybe I'll sneak into your apartment with a bag of oranges

483
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,570
溜进你的公寓里吃死你
and fructose you to death.

484
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,476
我们该从巴黎给总统寄张明信片
Hey, we should send potus a postcard from Paris.

485
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:28,979
收回你的狗屁决定用法语怎么说?
What's the French for shove it up your ass?

486
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:33,084
说实话我有点儿怕巴黎女人
God, Parisian women really intimidate me.

487
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,886
为什么?
Why?

488
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:38,657
不知道 她们有点儿太巴黎了
I don't know. They're so Parisian.

489
00:21:38,658 --> 00:21:40,625
你跟巴黎女人一样时髦
You're as stylish as any Parisian woman.

490
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:42,561
噢 谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

491
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:46,231
噢 你也是 谢谢
- Oh, so are you. - Thank you.

492
00:21:46,232 --> 00:21:48,733
停顿得有点儿久了 是不是?
That took too long, didn't it?

493
00:21:48,734 --> 00:21:50,602
我们去不了巴黎了 操
- We can't go to Paris. - Shit.

494
00:21:50,603 --> 00:21:52,804
不 我们都安排好行程了
No, whoa, whoa. We got all those tours lined up.

495
00:21:52,805 --> 00:21:54,205
你怎么又说... 安静 怎么了?
What are you talk... - be quiet. What?

496
00:21:54,206 --> 00:21:56,207
他们预感参议院投票结果会是平局
They're anticipating another tied vote in the Senate.

497
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,776
您又得回去主持了
You need to head back to preside again.

498
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:59,644
敲小槌的时刻到了 哪项法案?
- It's gavel time. - What bill is it?

499
00:21:59,645 --> 00:22:02,647
原话是该抡起大榔头了 我知道 我问你是哪项法案?
- That was a play on it's hammer time. - I know. What bill is it?

500
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:08,120
不是吧 是Macauley修正案?
No. No. It's the Macauley amendment?

501
00:22:08,121 --> 00:22:10,456
是的 实质上就是绿色产业
Yeah. It's the meat of clean jobs.

502
00:22:10,457 --> 00:22:13,126
您打算投支持还是反对?
Oh. - Which way are you gonna vote?

503
00:22:13,127 --> 00:22:17,163
按照我的原则和良知的指引
The way that my principles and conscience tell me to go.

504
00:22:17,164 --> 00:22:18,565
好吧
Okay.

505
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:20,900
你觉得该支持还是反对?
Which way do you think that should be?

506
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,138
我已经说过我的看法了
Look, you already know my feelings on this.

507
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:27,274
总统绝对不希望
The President does not want

508
00:22:27,275 --> 00:22:29,442
绿色产业修正案通过
the clean jobs amendment passed in any form.

509
00:22:31,012 --> 00:22:32,712
Dan 说句话
Dan, talk, please.

510
00:22:32,713 --> 00:22:35,282
在平局的情况下 投支持
If it comes down to a tie, vote for.

511
00:22:35,283 --> 00:22:37,951
你得支持自己的政策 是吗 你这么看?
you back your own policy. - Yeah? you think so?

512
00:22:37,952 --> 00:22:39,086
不 是的
No. - Yes.

513
00:22:39,087 --> 00:22:41,755
你真的希望我
So you are actually saying

514
00:22:41,756 --> 00:22:44,024
毁了这项政策 毁了我们数月
that you want me to destroy the policy

515
00:22:44,025 --> 00:22:45,926
甚至是数年的工作成果吗
that you and I have been working on for months,

516
00:22:45,927 --> 00:22:47,729
想想我们的努力 Amy?
actually years if you think about it, Amy?

517
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,497
是的
Yes. - Wow.

518
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,899
好吧 说白了就是
All right, let me get this straight.

519
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,636
你 Dan 如此讨厌这项政策
So you, Dan, who are absolutely against this policy,

520
00:22:54,637 --> 00:22:58,273
别解释 却想让我投支持票
don't say otherwise, you want me to vote for it.

521
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:00,842
而你 Amy 你赞同这项政策
And you, Amy, who love this policy,

522
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:02,443
却想让我投反对
you want me to vote against it.

523
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:05,213
是吗
Yeah?

524
00:23:05,214 --> 00:23:09,184
这难道是什么狗屁诡异的镜中世界么
This is some weird ass through the looking glass shit right now.

525
00:23:09,185 --> 00:23:10,885
投反对 投支持
Vote against. - Vote for.

526
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:14,322
女士 他们让你下去
Hey, ma'am. They need you on the floor.

527
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:15,957
哦 伙计 Ahem
Oh, boy. Ahem.

528
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,859
好吧 那么...
All right, well...

529
00:23:20,162 --> 00:23:22,197
待会儿见了 同志们
See you later, folks.

530
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:24,366
祝我好运
Wish me luck.

531
00:23:26,703 --> 00:23:29,305
是你让Macauley加上这则修正案的 是不是?
You got Macauley to add this amendment, didn't you?

532
00:23:29,306 --> 00:23:31,307
我就知道是你 Macauley自己有脑子
I know you did. - Macauley is his own man.

533
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:33,843
如果是你干的
If you did this,

534
00:23:33,844 --> 00:23:36,579
你就是违背了Selina的命令
you went against Selina's explicit orders

535
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,350
还将这整间办公室置于险境
and you have put this entire office into a salad spinner of fuck.

536
00:23:43,988 --> 00:23:47,556
你干嘛呢 在查球赛比分?
What, are you checking your fantasy fucking football scores?

537
00:23:47,557 --> 00:23:50,025
去你妈的
Get the fuck off it.

538
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:55,464
噢 伙计 她会怎么做?
Hey. Oh, man. What's she gonna do?

539
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:57,933
按我说的做
What I said.

540
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:02,004
本次投票 支持票50 反对票50
On this vote, the yeas are 50, the nays are 50.

541
00:24:02,005 --> 00:24:04,306
参议院投票结果正反参半
The Senate being equally divided,

542
00:24:04,307 --> 00:24:07,776
副总统投反对票
the Vice President votes in the negative

543
00:24:07,777 --> 00:24:10,313
这项修正案未通过
and the amendment is not agreed to.

544
00:24:15,719 --> 00:24:18,788
我参政就是为了做这些吗 Amy?
Is this what I came into politics to do, Amy?

545
00:24:18,789 --> 00:24:20,623
我就是象征性地问问
It's a rhetorical question.

546
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:23,326
显然我参政不是为了这个
Obviously I didn't come into politics to do this.

547
00:24:23,327 --> 00:24:25,461
告诉你个好消息
On a happy note, we reassigned

548
00:24:25,462 --> 00:24:28,164
那个笑眯眯的特勤处人员被我们调走了
The smiling secret service guy. - Mmm.

549
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,399
你至少用不着担心带枪的傻笑白痴了
It's one less grinning idiot with a gun you have to worry about.

550
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,635
噢 天呐 什么事?
Oh, God, what?

551
00:24:32,636 --> 00:24:35,271
很抱歉打扰您 女士 你已经打扰到我了
- Sorry to disturb you, ma'am. - And yet you are disturbing me.

552
00:24:35,272 --> 00:24:37,206
总统非常焦虑 经过了近期的各种事件
Potus is anxious, after recent events,

553
00:24:37,207 --> 00:24:41,109
您似乎还未意识到他希望您不要过问政府事务
that you don't feel he's trying to nudge you out of the process of government.

554
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:44,279
真是周到呢 不是吗Amy?
Oh, isn't that thoughtful, Amy?

555
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,381
他希望您能牵头开展一项非常重大
So he would like you to head up a program

556
00:24:46,382 --> 00:24:48,817
又深得其心的项目
that is very important and very dear to his heart.

557
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:51,252
不 不 不
No, no, no, no, no.

558
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:53,120
你不会这么对我的
You do not do this to me.

559
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:57,458
别告诉我是肥胖项目 别告诉我是这个
Do not say that it is obesity. Do not say that to me.

560
00:24:57,459 --> 00:25:00,095
是肥胖项目 不 不
- It's obesity. - No, no.

561
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:01,863
抱歉 女士 但您得负责减肥计划
I'm sorry, ma'am, but you have drawn the fat straw.

562
00:25:01,864 --> 00:25:04,667
我会将相关文件下达给您的团队
I will have all the relevant documents forwarded onto your team.

563
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:07,070
好吧 你该洗洗睡了 出去吧
Okay, it's your bedtime. Get out of my office.

564
00:25:07,071 --> 00:25:08,905
晚安
Good night.

565
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,940
天呐

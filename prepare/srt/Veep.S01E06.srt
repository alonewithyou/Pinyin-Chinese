1
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:25,631
这个优德鸡的项目简直就是... (一鸡肉快餐连锁店)
The whole Chick-fil-A narrative is just...

2
00:00:25,632 --> 00:00:27,533
如果可以说的话 先生
I mean, if I may, sir, it's...

3
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,302
那就是饮食界的奇葩啊 我说真的
It's food-nomenal. Really. It really is.

4
00:00:29,303 --> 00:00:32,004
现在外面施工成这样
With that construction outside, man,

5
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:34,507
搞得我刚才在路上堵了整整两个小时
I was stuck in traffic for two hours.

6
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:36,810
我的膀胱都要憋爆了
My bladder was like a fuckin' blimp.

7
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:40,380
你应该多和食品制造商聊聊
You should maybe talk some more to the food manufacturing guys

8
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,781
还有健康顾问们 好的
And The health advisors. - Yeah.

9
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:44,250
来吧 女士 小聊一下就行了
Come on, ma'am, just some small talk.

10
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,819
不行的话微聊也可以
Even tiny talk will do.

11
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,721
好的 我懂 我会去的
Yeah, I know. I'm gonna do it.

12
00:00:48,722 --> 00:00:50,657
天哪 这一早上就白瞎了啊
God, what a waste of a morning.

13
00:00:50,658 --> 00:00:53,826
要是想对我逼供的话  根本就不用上什么老虎凳辣椒水
If you ever want me to confess, don't rip out my fingernails,

14
00:00:53,827 --> 00:00:56,196
让我吃他妈一星期的素我就全招了
just make me eat like a vegan for a fuckin' week.

15
00:00:56,197 --> 00:00:59,166
副总统看起来脸色跟吸血鬼似的
The VP look like she's about ready to open up a vein.

16
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:00,735
你没事吧?
You okay?

17
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:03,305
你看起来好像有点敷衍的意思 你知道吗? Amy
- You seem to be phoning it in a little. - You know what, Amy?

18
00:01:03,306 --> 00:01:05,808
我从来就不想当副总统
I'm the veep I never wanted to be.

19
00:01:05,809 --> 00:01:10,514
我得跟这帮二货说吃沙拉和体重指数
I'm talking salad wraps and body mass index to these idiots.

20
00:01:10,515 --> 00:01:12,115
你真的该去了...
You should really just go and...

21
00:01:12,116 --> 00:01:14,518
是的 我知道 感觉我的灵魂已经从下面拉出去了
Yeah, I know, feel my soul slide out of my ass.

22
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,119
好了 这个你拿着
All right, here. You take that.

23
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,623
我现在来积蓄能量了
I'm building up the energy right now.

24
00:01:18,624 --> 00:01:20,591
这个闻起来跟出租车似的
This smells like the inside of a taxi cab.

25
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:23,862
同志们好啊 首长好
- Hi, guys. Hello. - Hello.

26
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:24,996

一会我们照了集体照你们就可以走了
We'll get the group shot taken and then you guys can get moving.

28
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,200
太好了
Awesome!

29
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:30,835
这一早上效率真高!
What a productive morning.

30
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:32,503
你们觉得这里有东西能放到你们店里卖的么?
Can you envision selling some of these items

31
00:01:32,504 --> 00:01:34,439
当然了 是的 也许色拉卷吧

葡萄...葡萄战无不胜啊
- Yeah, wraps. - Grapes. I mean, grapes are always good.

34
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:40,512
那些黄色的东西看起来...很...
Grapes are... hey, you can't beat grapes.

35
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:44,784
我告诉你们这些都是本地产的 而且都是有机食品 噢 哇
Those yellow things look... so...

36

- Orgasmic's more like it, right? - Oh.

39
00:01:51,927 --> 00:01:55,396
我们现在这里不拍照 好吗?
I'll have some of what you're having.

40
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,234
对不起 不 没关系的
- Do you have a zoom on that thing? - Oh, Ken, you know what?

41
00:02:05,141 --> 00:02:08,143
你今晚回华盛顿么 Gary?
You back to DC tonight, Gary?

43
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:13,115
我爸今天过生日 不错
my dad is having his birthday dinner. - Nice.

44
00:02:15,619 --> 00:02:19,322
不 他非常不尊重我的工作
He has very little respect for my job.

45
00:02:19,323 --> 00:02:22,059
实际上他更希望我在这里工作
He actually much rather me work here.

46
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,162
搞伙食承包么? 不 在棒球场工作

47
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:26,663
Oh.

48
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,098
做男人中的男人 运动员
A man's man, a jock.

Rarrrh! One of those guys.

50
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:33,971
哇 那很难吧 谁说不是呢
- Wow, that's gotta be tough. - Yeah, tell me about it.

51
00:02:35,441 --> 00:02:37,876
我是说对他而言很难
I meant for him.

52
00:02:37,877 --> 00:02:40,112
苍天啊 你知道吗 Ken?
- Jesus. - Okay, you know what, Ken?

53
00:02:40,113 --> 00:02:41,747
不能这么近 好吗? 好的
- Not so close, okay? - Okay.

54
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:45,351
谁也不用知道我哪边眉毛需要修了
Nobody needs to know which of my eyebrow hairs needs to be plucked.

55
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,586
对不起
Sorry.

00:02:46,587 --> 00:02:49,055
集体照的事情怎么样了?

把你皱上去的眉毛...
Turn that frown...

Okay. - Okay.

62
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,334
你看见他老摸我了没?
Do you see that he keeps touching me?

63
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,870
是的 我注意到了 而且他的手好小啊
- Yeah, I've noticed. - And his hands are really small.

64
00:03:02,871 --> 00:03:06,273
他那敏感的小辣手啊~~
It's his feely, little, touchy, hot hands.

65
00:03:06,274 --> 00:03:07,741
得有人告诉他他是为白宫工作的
Someone needs to tell him that he's working

66
00:03:07,742 --> 00:03:09,343
不是后宫 (Penthouse 著名成人杂志)
with the White House and not Penthouse.

67
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:12,445
能借一步说话吗?
Hey, can I talk to you privately just for a second?

68
00:03:12,446 --> 00:03:14,180
好的
Okay.

69
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:16,415
你们和甜甜脆搞的这个项目简直就是...
The whole thing that you guys have done with Krispy Kreme is just...

70
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,118
如果可以说的话 那就是饮食界的奇葩啊 真的
if I may, it's food-nomenal, really.

71
00:03:19,119 --> 00:03:22,488
你知道我和Ted在交往 对吧?
So you know that I've been seeing Ted, right?

72
00:03:22,489 --> 00:03:24,623
嗯哼 不久之前
- Mm-hmm. - A while ago,

73
00:03:24,624 --> 00:03:28,727
我们喝了不少酒 又听了Springsteen的歌
a lot of wine was drunk and Springsteen was listened to

74
00:03:28,728 --> 00:03:31,262
事情有点小失控...
and things got a little bit out of hand.

75
00:03:31,263 --> 00:03:33,198
你们去偷车了?
You stole a car?

76
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,300
我们滚床单的时候没有用套子
We had unprotected sex,

77
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:38,169
而且我觉得我怀孕了
and I think I might be pregnant.

78
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,671
Oh...

79
00:03:39,672 --> 00:03:42,607
这是有可能的 Amy
It's a possibility, Amy.

80
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,909
我还没有到更年期
I haven't reached menopause yet, you know.

81
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,445
我也不是不孕不育啥的 我知道这个可能性不大
I'm not barren. I know it's unlikely.

82
00:03:47,446 --> 00:03:50,315
说不定我和30个男的
I could probably have unprotected sex with 30 men,

83
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:53,718
不要套子轮流来也不会出事
one right after the other, and it would be totally fine.

84
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:55,453
我的意思是 不 不会出大事
I mean, no, it wouldn't be totally fine.

85
00:03:55,454 --> 00:03:57,089
我是说 这个绝对是出大事了
I mean, that would be a horrible thing.

86
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,191
我不是在怀疑你怀孕的能力 女士
I'm not doubting your fertility, ma'am,

87
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,527
但是一个未婚妈妈
but an unwed mother

88
00:04:01,528 --> 00:04:03,596
不就是总统身边的定时炸弹?
one aneurism away from the presidency?

89
00:04:03,597 --> 00:04:05,799
你觉得这个会是什么效果?
How do you think that plays?

90
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,734
这个包包有一个大格可以放东西
The bag has got one big storage area

91
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:10,170
还有60个小格子分布在各处
and then there are 60 separate pockets within the area.

92
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:11,471
- Hmm. - Wow!

93
00:04:11,472 --> 00:04:13,073
看吧? 那可是不少要记的东西 Gary
- Right? - That is a lot to remember, Gary.

94
00:04:13,074 --> 00:04:14,808
就是 就是
I know, I know.

95
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:16,877
但是你连看都不看就知道?
But can you do it without looking?

96
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,378
你来考我
Try me.

97
00:04:18,379 --> 00:04:20,013
眼药水
Eye drops.

98
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:23,382
Ooh!

99
00:04:23,383 --> 00:04:25,584
湿巾 有香的还是无香的?
- Wipes. - Scented, unscented?

100
00:04:26,486 --> 00:04:28,854
有香的
Scented.

101
00:04:28,855 --> 00:04:30,489
- Bam! - Wow!

102
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,925
太牛了... 真难以置信
- Knock it... - That's unbelievable.

103
00:04:32,926 --> 00:04:35,561
希望我没有怀孕 否则的话
I hope I'm not pregnant, because, fuck, if I am,

104
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:37,864
我就完了 你知道吗?
I'm just finished, you know?

105
00:04:37,865 --> 00:04:40,734
女士 我们行动起来!
- Ma'am. - Let's get moving!

106
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:44,938
你知道不能跟别人说吧? 我知道
- You know you'll have to keep it. - I know.

107
00:04:44,939 --> 00:04:49,844
除非我们去墨西哥渡个特别假期啥的...
Unless we go on some sort of special vacation to Mexico and...

108
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:52,047
然后把医生弄死在沙漠里
kill the doctor in the desert.

109
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:53,715
父亲知道吗?
Father know?

110
00:04:53,716 --> 00:04:55,917
什么 你不是玩我吧? 我才15岁么?
What, are you kidding me? What am I, 15?

111
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,053
我的意思是Ted 我去!不 不知道
- I mean Ted. - Oh, shit. No.

112
00:04:59,054 --> 00:05:02,322
那一头我还在努力
No. I'm still working on that one.

113
00:05:02,323 --> 00:05:06,326
你的相机是什么的? 这是部5D(市价1-2万rmb)
- What are you shooting with? - This is a 5D.

114
00:05:06,327 --> 00:05:09,029
不是1D么?(市价5万左右) 不是
- Not a 1D? - No.

115
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,897
我拍这个用不着1D
Why would I need a 1D to shoot this?

116
00:05:10,898 --> 00:05:12,298
我有一部1D
I have a 1D.

117
00:05:12,299 --> 00:05:14,634
那个更贵 但是确实是好相机
It's more expensive, but it's a really nice camera.

118
00:05:14,635 --> 00:05:17,203
你拍很多体育活动么? 连续的运动?
You shoot a lot of sports? Moving action?

119
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:19,840
还是拍很多水鸟抓鱼的照片?
You take hundreds of pictures of herons catching fish?

120
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,010
否则的话你就用不着1D
Because otherwise you don't need a 1D.

121
00:05:23,011 --> 00:05:26,447
是的 但是我有一部1D
Right, but I have a 1D.

如果是真的话 那对她来说
'Cause if it is, the best thing for her legacy

154
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,758
最好的结局就是在显肚子之前被刺杀了

不是完全确定
It's not definite.

156
00:06:46,393 --> 00:06:48,027
还得测试一下才知道
She still needs to take some tests.

157
00:06:48,028 --> 00:06:50,363
好吧 那我猜我应该在媒体发布会上加上这一条
Okay. I'll guess I'll just add this to the press release.

他用的是Paco Rabanne
It was Paco Rabanne.

253

我相信你问的是无聊的问题 Leon
I believe, ahem, you asked a boring question, Leon,

261
00:10:43,135 --> 00:10:44,569
所以我才给了你一个无聊的答案
and I gave a boring answer.

262
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:48,105
这就像碳补偿一样
That's like carbon offsetting.

263
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:51,074
Mike 我不会笑的 你可能会丢掉饭碗的
Mike, I wouldn't be smiling. You might lose your job.

你懂我意思吗?
You understand my point?

265
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:55,178
你不觉得Selina Meyer就为了微笑
You don't find it repugnant that Selina Meyer

266
00:10:55,179 --> 00:10:57,213
炒掉一位特勤人员很讨厌么?(与怀孕音近)
let a secret service agent go for smiling?

267
00:10:57,214 --> 00:10:58,915
讨厌? 是的
Repugnant? - Yes.

268
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:00,817
是说副总统讨厌么?
You're calling the vice president repugnant?

269
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:02,752
这个说法很情绪化 先生
That's a very emotive term, sir,

270
00:11:02,753 --> 00:11:04,988
而且还有点神经 我要说
and a little prissy, I might add.

271
00:11:04,989 --> 00:11:07,924
我19岁的时候曾经在监狱里呆过一晚
I spent a night in jail when I was 19 once.

272
00:11:07,925 --> 00:11:09,291
那都比这个有意思
That was more fun than this.

273
00:11:09,292 --> 00:11:10,793
如果我们在这儿还得多呆一分钟
Well, if we get trapped here another minute,

274
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:12,561
我就要杀了你吃肉
I'm gonna kill you and eat you,

275
00:11:12,562 --> 00:11:14,730
因为我不能再吃他妈的沙拉三明治了
because I will not eat another fuckin' falafel.

276
00:11:14,731 --> 00:11:16,565
他妈的Jimmy Olsen (超人的好朋友摄影记者)
Hey, Jimmy fuckin' Olsen,

你最好是在我爆你菊

让你另一个眼红起来之前消失
and give you another kind of red eye to worry about.

Yes, I can tell what are you saying now.

287
00:11:42,228 --> 00:11:44,195
你读出来我之前
Could you lip-read earlier

288
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:46,264
对Amy说你的事了么?
when I was talking about you to Amy?

289

没错 所以要严格确认

我要买哪种验孕棒 是不是有很多种类啊
What kind of test do I get? Are there different kinds of tests?

326
00:13:16,122 --> 00:13:17,789
我要怎么解释 我买什么

I don't blame you. That's gonna be a long labor.

336
00:13:39,113 --> 00:13:41,213
人家要轮班才能把孩子从你体内拔出来

虽然我们必须呆在体育场内
Well, we have to stay within the stadium,

341
00:13:48,988 --> 00:13:51,889
但还是可以邀请他们下去 跟金莺队的球员碰个面

342
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:54,759
行 我们就这么做
Okay, that's exactly what we gonna do.

你不要老说开局投手
You don't have multiple starting pitchers.

360
00:14:31,464 --> 00:14:32,731
这儿只有一个投手板
There's one pitcher's mound.

你可以的 Amy 不行

468
00:18:49,985 --> 00:18:52,320
哥弹吉他是为了泡妞 不是留住小朋友 知道吧
My guitar is for seduction, not crowd control, all right?

469
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,356
就算今晚月色不错 那也是一回事 老子不干
Granted, on a good night that's one and the same, but still.

470
00:18:55,357 --> 00:18:56,758
不 老娘去找把吉他
No, we're finding you a guitar.

She here yet?

477
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,779
没到 也是啊 她不爱准时
No. No, of course not, because she hates punctuality

478
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,348
也不爱善治
almost as much as good governance.

479
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:19,116
那我们接下来干嘛呢
So what should we do, guys?

480
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:32,063

Why would we need to ban smiling?

483
00:19:34,633 --> 00:19:36,768
又不是说我们一有时间就会做这个
It's not like something we have time for in the first place.

484
00:19:38,104 --> 00:19:40,244
女士 Sue 听着...

No, no, no, he didn't really.

488
00:19:46,179 --> 00:19:47,513
我们要假装他求了
We're just gonna pretend that he did.

489
00:19:47,514 --> 00:19:49,282
那行 我一口咬定他做了

00:19:54,154 --> 00:19:56,923
儿童勇气奖那天...他会求婚吗
The Children of Courage Awards... Would he have proposed then?

494
00:19:56,924 --> 00:19:59,626
不行 那些小朋友有秃头症
No, no, uh-uh. That's kids with alopecia,

495
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:02,028

504
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:21,781
不过如果你...倾向于疯克乐什么的 (黑人爵士乐)
But if you really... if you get into some of the funkier stuff,

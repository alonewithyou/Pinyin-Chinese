那今天Meyer副总统很有压力咯 Rod?
So Vice President Meyer is under pressure today, Rod.

2
00:00:08,278 --> 00:00:09,778
说得对 Vic 她因为人家冲她笑
That's right, Vic. She fired one of her

3
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:11,780
就炒掉了一名特勤工作人员
secret service men because he smiled.

4
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,151
他不是被炒了 是调动了
He wasn't fired, he was reassigned.

5
00:00:14,152 --> 00:00:16,420
这对副总统的幕僚长 Amy Brookheimer来说面子上可不好看
This doesn't look good for the VP's chief of staff Amy Brookheimer.

6
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:19,791
Amy 你现在听的是Crock频道么?
Amy, you listening to Crock FM right now?

7
00:00:19,792 --> 00:00:21,728

Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.

8
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:25,298

Well, don't sweat it. I can still bust some moves in this town.

9
00:00:25,299 --> 00:00:26,766
手段? 不是吧 Mike?
Bust some moves? Really, Mike?

10

I have a black belt in Mike Kwan Do.

Hands off the suit.

14
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:37,775
那就怪我吧 Brookheimer
Uh-oh, blame me Brookheimer.

15
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:39,977
不许笑了 Vic 那可是叛国!
Stop laughing there, Vic. That's treason.

16
00:00:39,978 --> 00:00:42,145
喂?
Hello? - Dan.

17
00:00:42,146 --> 00:00:45,414
你看到Amy出糗都高兴得硬了吧?
You must have a huge schadenboner over this Amy flack.

18
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:48,582
我对我同事如此公然血腥...
Oh, I take no pleasure in my colleague's very public, brutal...

19
00:00:48,583 --> 00:00:50,784
我这要看电视呢 你能挪一下吗?
I'm trying to watch TV. Would you please move?

20
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,121
而且有可能是事业终点的受辱 完全不感到高兴 Jonah
And probably career-ending humiliation, Jonah.

21
00:00:53,122 --> 00:00:56,692
天 她这回肯定要爆发大姨妈了
God, she is gonna go ape-shit menstrual over this.

22
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:59,229
嘿 我这正和电信公司打电话呢 你能别在那嚷嚷大姨妈么?
Hey, I'm on the phone with AT&T. Can you stop shouting menstrual?

23
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,731
是啊 她可能会有点大姨妈来了的感觉
Yeah, you know, she'll probably go a little menstrual.

24
00:01:01,732 --> 00:01:05,068
她可能会的 但是你仔细一想的话
Yeah, she probably will. Although, when you think about it,

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,504
这个对你来说不利 是吗?
- it's actually kind of worse for you. - Is that right?

26
00:01:07,505 --> 00:01:10,474
嗯 副总统办公室一直不停地出事
Well, the VP'S office is a cataclysm on spin cycle.

27
00:01:10,475 --> 00:01:12,843
而且你们还有怀孕流言满天飞
And then you got that pregnancy rumor flying around

28
00:01:12,844 --> 00:01:15,146
一些乱七八糟的
like the contents of a broken fucking condom.

29
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:18,649
这一条肯定是最先爆出来的 你已经是活死人了...搞毛啊?
It's gonna be last in and first out and you're a dead Dan walk... what the fuck?

30
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,818
这玩意太脏了得跟碗一起洗
This is going in with the dirty dishes, man.

31
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:25,689
天哪 要是弄坏了的话 我就算在你丫的房租里!
For fuck's sake. If this is broken, I'm adding it to your fucking rent.

32
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:29,091
请拨打热线参与话题 Amy Brookheimer应否离开?
Please call in on this one. Should Amy Brookheimer go?

33
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,208
重点是 你们搞好治安
But the bottom line is, you keep the streets safe,

34
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,843
我就搞定你们的预算
I'll keep your budget safe.

35
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:48,646
呃 我本来想说这让我喜笑颜开的
Well, I was gonna say that brings a smile to my face,

36
00:01:48,647 --> 00:01:50,481
不过这就不安全了 对吧女士?
but that would be safe, wouldn't it, ma'am?

37
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:52,951
这个好笑 Bill 你被炒了
That's very funny, Bill. You're fired.

38
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:55,720
我开玩笑的 开玩笑的 开玩笑的
I'm kidding. I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

00:01:57,857 --> 00:01:59,958
好的 我恐怕要离席了 先生们
Okay, yes. I'm afraid I have to go, gentlemen.

41
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:07,131
Mike 这可不是故事
Mike, this is not a story.

42
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,733
Collins对我做了几个表情 然后就调他走了
Collins made a bunch of faces, he was reassigned.

43
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:12,435
这就不应该上新闻 这到底怎么捅出去的?
That shouldn't be news. How in the hell did this happen?

44
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:14,638
这他妈可是特勤处啊
It's the secret service, for Christ's sake.

45
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,640
特勤处的特就是说要闭嘴的意思
Secret as in shut the fuck up.

46
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:19,043
特勤的意思就是说给我工作 好吗?
And service as in you work for me, okay?

47
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:20,377
那你为什么不闭上你的鸟嘴?
So why don't you shut the fuck up?

48
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:22,412
我们有一个死敌 我要知道他是谁
We have an enemy and I want a name

49
00:02:22,413 --> 00:02:24,348
然后往死里问他要答案
and a severed head that answers to that name,

50
00:02:24,349 --> 00:02:26,550
如果他还能说话的话
or would if it could still talk.

51
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:28,919
好了 我要进办公室了
All right, I'm gonna be in my office.

噢 Gary 副总统
Ooh, Gary, did the veep

是不是边骂边把门摔你脸上了?
just bitch-slap you with a door?

55
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,661
她不是有心的 她今天脑子里的事太多了
She didn't mean that. She's got a lot on her mind today.

56
00:02:37,662 --> 00:02:39,563
对 你是说要炒Amy之类的么?
Oh, yeah, you mean like firing Amy?

57
00:02:39,564 --> 00:02:42,766
还是说要炒某些私下和Macauley搞关系 来破坏总统事情的人呢
Or someone who's undermining the president by back-channeling Macauley.

58
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:46,035
一派胡言 好吧 我要告诉你们一些事

我不能说 我不能告诉你们
I can't say this. I can't tell you this.

61
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,206
Gary 你为什么话只说一半?
Gary, why are you talking in cliffhangers?

62
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:54,810
Selina流产了
Selina's had a miscarriage.

63

65
00:03:00,518 --> 00:03:03,119
我会说是从他妈的政治困境中解脱了
Free from a major fucking political headache, I'd say.

66
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,887
你这也太冷了吧 Dan
That's deep space cold, Dan.

67
00:03:04,888 --> 00:03:06,689

Explains why you piss liquid nitrogen.

68
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,657

69
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:10,626

70
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:12,495

The skyscraper of shit has arrived.

Selina Meyer 副总统失控了么?
Selina Meyer, has this veep lost control?

84
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,304
呃 呃 呃 她声称是个环保主义者
- Are, are, are. - She says she's an environmentalist,

85
00:03:52,305 --> 00:03:54,106
可她却否决了环境保护的议案
but she vetoes environmental protection.

86
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,808
她发起的绿色产业委员会里
She sets up a clean jobs task force

87
00:03:56,809 --> 00:03:59,444
不止有一位 而是两位石油界人士
that includes not one, but two oil men.

88
00:03:59,445 --> 00:04:00,778
我来告诉你真相
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

89
00:04:00,779 --> 00:04:02,613
到底副总统的脑子是什么状态
What is the mental state of a veep

90
00:04:02,614 --> 00:04:04,314
才能为了微笑而炒掉一个人?
that fires a man for smiling?

91
00:04:06,684 --> 00:04:08,551
这一段我最喜欢了 你能...
I love this part. - Could you...

我完全不知道我办公室里发生了什么事
And I don't have any idea what's going on in my office.

94
00:04:15,326 --> 00:04:18,361
好吧 把你的断腿收起来赶紧滚吧 Jonah
All right, pack up your limbs and get the fuck out, Jonah.

95
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:20,596
把他赶出去 嘿 别怪报信的人啊
- Get him out. - Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

96
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:22,831
我能上手吗? 你没有机会打过我的
- Is punching allowed? - Oh, you wouldn't stand a chance.

97
00:04:22,832 --> 00:04:24,500
我手比你长多了
I have a much longer reach.

98
00:04:24,501 --> 00:04:28,037
大家都看过这个了么? 没有!
- Did everybody get a chance to see this? - No!

99
00:04:28,038 --> 00:04:30,273
我们怎么止损?
I mean, how are we gonna shut this negativity down?

100
00:04:30,274 --> 00:04:32,976
Amy 我们要怎么办? 呃 这不准确
- Amy, what are we gonna do? - Yeah, well, it's inaccurate.

101
00:04:32,977 --> 00:04:35,913
技术上来说 特勤处的那个人是调走了
Technically, the secret service guy was reassigned.

102
00:04:35,914 --> 00:04:38,816
就是 而且技术上来说我们也没有 放两个石油界的人
Yeah, and technically we didn't put two oil guys

103
00:04:38,817 --> 00:04:41,319
在绿色产业委员会里 那我懂了
- on clean jobs task force. - Oh, yeah, I see.

104
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,055
技术上来说这个办公室也运作流畅着呢
And technically this is a fully functioning office, too.

105
00:04:44,056 --> 00:04:46,525
嗯 那个特勤处的小丑肯定爆了我们的料
Well, that secret service clown has obviously leaked us.

106
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,060
说得对 Mike 很好
That's right, Mike. Good. You know what?

107
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:50,096
你得去和他谈谈 好吗?
You're gonna have to go talk to him, okay?

108
00:04:50,097 --> 00:04:52,731
你是现在我们这个办公室里最接近正常的人了
You are the closest to normal we've got going in this office right now.

109
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:54,399
谢谢 我觉得
Thanks, I think.

110
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,067
好了 白宫发了一个要求
Okay, there's a White House request to publish

111
00:04:56,068 --> 00:04:57,935
说要公布所有特勤处工作人员的记录
all the secret service office personnel records.

112
00:04:57,936 --> 00:05:00,371
你玩我呢吧? 他们现在就要我们的记录?
Are you kidding me? They want our records now?

113
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,506
我们怎么办? 怎么办?
What are we gonna do? What?

114
00:05:02,507 --> 00:05:05,342
呃 我们必须公布那些材料
Well, we have to release those. And that has got me thinking

115
00:05:05,343 --> 00:05:08,078
那我们为什么不干脆把所有记录都公布了呢?
why not release all of our fucking records?

116
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:10,346
彻底解决这件事 你是说真的么?
full disclosure. - are you serious?

117
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:11,781
对 公布所有的东西
Yeah, publish everything.

118
00:05:11,782 --> 00:05:14,183
所有的邮件 所有的电话记录
All of our emails, all of our phone records.

119
00:05:14,184 --> 00:05:15,985
好的 好的 这样他们就没有时间仔细看了
Right, right, 'cause they won't have time to read everything.

120
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,354
我是说 你总不能什么都看
I mean, you can't read everything.

121
00:05:17,355 --> 00:05:18,488
我应该看的东西有一半都没看过
I don't read half the stuff I'm supposed to.

122
00:05:18,489 --> 00:05:21,291
那就是说我们显得什么都不藏着掖着
So by showing that we have nothing to hide,

123
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:23,427
可事实上却可以隐瞒一些东西
then we can actually hide some stuff.

124
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:25,162
Dan 你觉得呢?
Dan, what do you think about this?

125
00:05:25,163 --> 00:05:27,865
我只是觉得这个事情可能会把我们都搞废了
I just think that this could blow up in all of our faces.

126
00:05:27,866 --> 00:05:29,767
你不能因为不是你家孩子就...
Just because this isn't your baby, you don't...

127
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:33,104
天哪 真对不起 噢 没事的 没事的
- God, I am so sorry. - Oh, it's fine. It's fine.

128
00:05:33,105 --> 00:05:35,239
这就像加强版大姨妈一样 别担心
I mean, it was like a heavy period. Don't worry about it.

129
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,007
好吧 你们知道吗? 我们就这么干!
All right, you know what, guys? We're doing this.

130
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,176
我决定我们
I've made the decision that we are going to

131
00:05:39,177 --> 00:05:41,711
公开所有的通讯文件
release all of our correspondence.

132
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:44,347
现在玩的就是大结局
Full disclosure is now the name of the game.

133
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:46,582
Mike会给你交待剩下的细节
Mike will fill you in on the rest of it.

134
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:48,350
是吧 Mike? 是的 女士
- Right, Mike? - Yes, ma'am.

135
00:05:48,351 --> 00:05:51,353
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

136
00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:55,658
好了 这显然不会彻底解决的
All right, obviously it is not gonna be full disclosure.

137
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,262
这也就差不多解决一下
Okay? It's gonna be partial disclosure light.

138
00:05:59,263 --> 00:06:01,898
我们不能有书面记录
We don't want to have a paper trail

139
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,200
关于绿色产业的
on clean jobs.

140
00:06:03,201 --> 00:06:06,103
也不能有...你是在做记录么?
There can be no... Are you writing that down?

141
00:06:06,104 --> 00:06:09,006
你为什么要写下来?
Why would you be writing that down?

142
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:13,344
任何涉及Sidney Purcell 和绿色产业的东西都不能有
Nothing about Sidney Purcell having access to clean jobs, all right?

143
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:15,312
我们得查查Sue的日历 保证
We have to check Sue's calendar, make sure

144
00:06:15,313 --> 00:06:19,116
会议记录靠谱
there are no meetings there that I did-didn't have.

145
00:06:19,117 --> 00:06:21,284
那本偶然出现的种族歧视小册子也得销毁
The accidentally racist brochure that we had to shred.

146
00:06:21,285 --> 00:06:23,053
那个当然是要重新编过
Oh, we're gonna redact that for sure.

147
00:06:23,054 --> 00:06:25,689
不过吧 我还是觉得
But the thing is, is that I still think

148
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,424
里面应该有点料才行
there needs to be something embarrassing in there.

149
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,725
你们懂我意思吧? 当然
you know What I mean? - Sure.

150
00:06:28,726 --> 00:06:30,126
这样的话别人不会觉得我们是事前清理过了的
So it doesn't look as if we've just airbrushed

151
00:06:30,127 --> 00:06:31,394
对 这个想法很好 很好
the nipples out of this fucking thing.

152
00:06:31,395 --> 00:06:33,529
稍微处理一下起居记录
No, that's really good. And it makes... yeah.

153
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,567
媒体们就喜欢那种东西
Massages at the residence. The press will obsess about those.

154
00:06:37,568 --> 00:06:40,737
处理? 怎么处理? 你背上的面膜
Massages? What Massages? - your back facials.

155
00:06:40,738 --> 00:06:43,073
噢 背上的面膜? 什么东西?
Oh. - back facials? What?

156
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:45,209
对 我背上长痘痘了 背痘
Yeah, I get back acne. Backne.

157
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,512
好吧 这个我觉得问题不大
Okay, okay. I think we can live with that.

158
00:06:47,513 --> 00:06:49,080
那我们要公布起居日志么?
Shall we release the logs from the residence?

159
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:51,583
好的 当然 这个可以公布
Uh, yeah, sure. We can do that.

160
00:06:51,584 --> 00:06:53,319
好了吗? 好了
Okay? - Okay.

161
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,420
开始行动 噢 Dan
Got a plan. Oh, Dan.

162

我能跟你说一下吗?
Can I talk to you just for a quick sec?

163
00:06:57,556 --> 00:06:59,557
是 你要我留下么?
Yeah. - you want me to stay?

164
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:00,991
我叫你留下了吗?
Did I ask you to stay?

165

谢谢
Thank you.

166
00:07:06,264 --> 00:07:11,001
呃 Dan 听着 有什么事需要我担心么?
Um, Dan, listen, do I have anything that I need to be worried about?

167
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:13,336
随便举个例子哈
Just a random example might be

168
00:07:13,337 --> 00:07:16,806
比方说关于Macauley修正案什么的...
anything about the Macauley amendment you need...

169
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:18,641
不 不用 女士 不用么?
- No. No, ma'am. - No?

170
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:22,212
如果这间办公室里任何人和那个
Because if anyone thought this office

171
00:07:22,213 --> 00:07:25,448
违背总统愿望
had anything to do with that amendment,

172
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,551
和政策的修正案有瓜葛的话
which went against the president's wishes and policy,

173
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,953
这就完全不对头了哦
that would be completely wrong

174
00:07:30,954 --> 00:07:34,190
而且这会牵扯所有人
and it would be curtains for everyone.

175
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:35,491
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

176
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:38,795

但是我知道我不能知道
but I do know that I can't know

178
00:07:41,231 --> 00:07:42,965

00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:18,070
别的先不说
On top of everything else,

191
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:21,273
我想Ted要甩了我
I think that Ted is getting ready to dump me.

192
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:25,343
你那个...
What is that...

不 没有 我…
No, no, my...

195
00:08:29,714 --> 00:08:31,081
是在处理信息
processing information.

196
00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:33,516
点头代表我在缓冲哈
The nod of my head is like I'm buffering.

197
00:08:33,517 --> 00:08:37,254
好吧 那你缓冲完成之后
Oh, well, once you're done buffering,

198
00:08:37,255 --> 00:08:40,791
你在想什么呢?
what is it that you're thinking?

199
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,794
我不知道 也许震惊已经过去了
I don't know. Maybe the thrill is gone.

200
00:08:43,795 --> 00:08:45,095
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

201
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:48,099
就是说听到这个事情的震惊
Like the thrill of the whole power thing wore off.

00:12:48,344 --> 00:12:50,645
看起来副总统办公室因为
It seems the veep's office has compounded the problem

288
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:53,414
侮辱当事人为猩猩而把问题搞得更严重了
by insulting the man and calling him an ape.

289
00:12:53,415 --> 00:12:55,816
谁应该对这个疯狂的事件负责呢?
Who's responsible for this deranged campaign?

290
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:57,652
是新闻官Mike McLintock?
Mike McLintock, press officer?

291
00:12:57,653 --> 00:13:00,421
是幕僚长Amy Brookheimer 还是Selina Meyer本人呢?
Chief of staff Amy Brookheimer, or Selina Meyer herself?

292
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:03,057
当然了 她对此负有终极责任
Of course, she bears ultimate responsibility.

293
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,497
总统不会喜欢这个的
Potus will not like this.

294
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,100
这肯定会让总统那边崩溃的
This is gonna cause a total potal meltdown.

295
00:13:13,101 --> 00:13:15,168
好了 把他弄出去 Dan
All right, get him out of here, Dan.

296
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,670
你怎么不跑过去看看你能不能嘬你自己的蛋糕呢?
Yeah, why don't you run along and see if you can suck your own cake?

297
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,906
这个段子有内涵 Dan
Oh, that's clever, Dan.

298
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:22,175
是你说的么 Mike?
Did you say those things, Mike?

299
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,710
表现太好了 大文豪 真的
Ace play, Shakespeare. Really.

300
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:26,445
你居然骂一个老兵叫猩猩
When in doubt, call a vet an ape.

301
00:13:26,446 --> 00:13:29,114
你到底是走了什么后门才得到这份工作的啊?
Remind me, who did you blackmail to get this job?

302
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:32,117
好了 现在马上进办公室
All right, you know what? Let's get in my office right now.

303
00:13:32,118 --> 00:13:34,053
您的茶就快好了 谢谢
your tea is almost ready. - Thank you.

304
00:13:39,459 --> 00:13:43,196
又一次了 我们见证了这个办公室
Yet again we find ourselves in an office

305
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,766
有多他妈无能
that is completely non-fucking-functioning.

306
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:48,702
现在我们要怎么办
So what are we gonna do?

307
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:53,574
没错 我们要炒个人
Exactly. We are gonna fire someone.

308
00:13:53,575 --> 00:13:56,410
很好 你们有更好的主意吗
That's right. Does anybody have a better idea?

309
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,014
那...
All right, so...

310
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:03,583
炒谁呢
Who is it gonna be, huh?

311
00:14:05,152 --> 00:14:08,254
Sue 噢 Sue
- Sue. - Oh, Sue.

312
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,755
真好笑
That's funny, you guys.

313
00:14:09,756 --> 00:14:12,691
不过说实话 Sue还不够重要
But seriously, Sue's not important enough.

314
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,392
那谁重要呢
Who is?

315
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:20,166
哦 我知道了
Oh, I know.

316
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,335
你们三个就挺重要的
You three are important enough.

317
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:25,238
女士 我承诺会尽我所能
Ma'am, I just want to say I promise to do everything I can

318
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,608
来修补Amy漏洞层出的政策
to fix Amy's botched full disclosure policy

319
00:14:27,609 --> 00:14:29,376
和Mike的信口开河
and Mike's security blunder.

320
00:14:29,377 --> 00:14:32,413
嘿 拍马屁是修补不了嗝儿屁的  Dan
Hey, suck-up isn't gonna fix a fuck-up, Dan.

321
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:34,182
知道吗 你没有豁免权
All right? You're not exempt.

322
00:14:36,018 --> 00:14:37,252
Gary 嗯?
Gary. - Hmm?

323
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:38,820
我要找一个非常隐秘的地方
I need some sort of a discreet place

324
00:14:38,821 --> 00:14:41,190
跟Ted见个面
where I can have a rendezvous with Ted, please.

325
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,991

336
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:24,267
新闻界追得我屁滚尿流 哦 那挺好
- Press is up my ass. - Oh, so, okay, great.

337
00:15:24,268 --> 00:15:26,336
现在你能感受到我有多苦逼了
Then you know exactly what my world is like.

338
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:30,140
你放屁 我又没有个Mike Amy或他妈的Dan在身边
No, bullshit. I don't have a Mike, an Amy, or fucking Dan.

339
00:15:30,141 --> 00:15:32,075
你想要他们吗 那就拿走
Oh, do you want them? You can have them.

340

我他妈现在就能把他们仨打包送你 只要你想要
I'll give you a fucking deal on all three of them, too, if you want.

00:15:34,379 --> 00:15:36,280
你的待人之道可真好
That's a nice way to treat people.

342
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:38,849
这是我现在的真实感觉 水来了

你不用这么烦躁
You don't have to be snarky about this.

确定不会有任何影响
And just make sure there aren't any repercussions

371

374
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:09,073
嗯 不会 不行吗
- Mmm, uh-uh. - No?

375
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:13,144
不行 因为我不能再冒险跟他谈了
No, because I can't run the risk of talking to him again

376
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:16,314
我觉得他会要甩掉我
because I think that he is about to dump me.

377
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:20,150
所以我不想被别人甩
So I'm not gonna be the dumpee.

378
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:24,155
我要甩别人
I'm gonna be the dumper.

379

她再也不想见你了
That she doesn't want to see you anymore.

393
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,749
女士 你消失一个多小时了
Oh, ma'am. You've been off radar for over an hour.

394
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,784
我错过什么了没
Oh, did I miss anything?

395
00:18:26,785 --> 00:18:29,353
总统骑着狮子穿过去了还是什么
Did the president ride through on a lion or something?

396
00:18:29,354 --> 00:18:32,723
不 但你要去303博彩协会露个脸
No, but you need to do a drop-in on the Gaming Association in 303.

397
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:36,194

All right. I don't want to end up with a horse's head in my bed.

虽然现在枕头上确实有这个空间
Though there's room for one now.

我真心希望你是第一个知道的
I hope you find out first. I really do.

401
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:48,206
嘿 你知道吗 我要是被炒了 那就是很他妈大件事
Hey, you know what? I get fired, it's a big fucking deal.

402
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:49,474
炒了你还能当是提前退休
For you, it's early retirement.

403
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,276
啊 真有趣
Ah, that was fun.

404
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:53,879
刚有个资深律师把我的院子完全毁了
I just had a senior attorney completely trash my yard.

405
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,048
你还好吧 我帮你冲杯咖啡

He completely tore it up. I was afraid he was gonna cut my...

408
00:19:00,487 --> 00:19:02,588
等等 你刚是不是叫我兄弟了
Wait a second. Did you just call me buddy?

409
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:04,923
你们不听我说话的 你们从来都不会听我说话 发生什么事了
You don't listen to me. You never listen to me. What's going on?

410
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:07,025
没事 你们想从我这套东西
Nothing. - you want something from me.

411
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:09,695
你们想要我说是谁要被炒了
You want me to tell you who's getting fired.

412
00:19:09,696 --> 00:19:10,729
拜托 我们就想知道她在想什么
Come on, we just want to know what she's thinking.

413
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:12,497
我什么都不会说的
I'm not gonna tell you anything.

414
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:14,833
这样 忘掉细节问题
All right, you know what? Forget about the specifics.

415
00:19:14,834 --> 00:19:17,235
我们就当这儿有个女农场主
Let's pretend there's a female farmer

416
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:20,905
她养了一只马 一只羊和一只猪
and she's got a horse, a sheep, and a pig, okay?

417
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:23,274
她会丢掉哪个
Who does she get rid of?

418
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:25,409
猪
The pig.

419
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,843
妈的 等等 谁是猪
Shit. Wait. Who is that?

420
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:30,080
拜托 自己想嘛
Oh, come on. Work it out.

421
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:31,915
我干嘛要帮你们
Why should I help you guys?

422
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,185
Gary 副总统要吃午餐 就来
- Gary, veep needs her lunch. - I'm on it.

423
00:19:35,186 --> 00:19:38,689
我宁愿当猪 也不想做骑着高马的死猴子
I'd rather be a pig than an ass-monkey up on his high horse.

424
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,424
看 这三种动物适合你
There, that's three animals for you.

425
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,032
你刚是不是悄悄贴过来了
Did you just sidle?

426
00:19:49,033 --> 00:19:51,868
我从来没见过你这样
I don't think I've ever seen you sidle.

427
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:54,971
是这样 Selina要炒个人
Look, Selina wants to fire somebody.

428
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:56,972
很明显 我不希望是我
Obviously, I don't want it to be me.

429
00:19:56,973 --> 00:19:58,507
但说实话 我也不希望是你
But honestly, I don't want it to be you.

430
00:19:58,508 --> 00:20:01,643
继续 我很期待你说服我
Oh, go on. Looking forward to you selling this one to me.

431
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:04,378
我们得达成自杀合约
We should form a suicide pact. All right?

432
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:07,114
如果她要炒我 你就走 反之亦然
If she tries to fire me, you walk and vice versa.

433
00:20:07,115 --> 00:20:09,049
她不会同时炒我们俩个
She's not gonna fire both of us.

434
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,651
这样太有危机感了
That would look like a crisis.

435
00:20:10,652 --> 00:20:13,520
因此 我们俩个她都不会炒
Therefore, she can fire neither of us.

436
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:16,056
我只有一个条件...我要先看着你死
One condition... I watch you die first

437
00:20:16,057 --> 00:20:19,559
再反复捅你来确认
and I get to stab you repeatedly to make sure.

438
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:23,597
McLintock也要参加自杀合约
McLintock wants in on the suicide pact.

439
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,467
什么 是的 经典的一步
What? - Yeah. a classic move.

440
00:20:26,468 --> 00:20:28,837
我九十年代也用过这招
I did one of these back in the '90s

441
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,472
为Hartigan议员工作时
when I worked for congressman Hartigan.

442
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:33,209
干嘛要让你跟我们一起自杀合约
Why would we let you in on our suicide pact?

443
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:35,311
因为三个比两个要好
Because three is better than two.

444
00:20:35,312 --> 00:20:37,813
如果是睾丸那就不一定了
Not with testicles.

445
00:20:42,686 --> 00:20:46,755
我看到了一封小电子邮件
I came across a little email

446
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:49,457
是你写给Macauley的幕僚长的
from you to Macauley's chief of staff.

447
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,859
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

448
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,760
你不知道那电邮吗 基本能确认
You don't know about an email that basically confirms

449
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:55,797
你跟Macauley参议员有私交呢
you had talks with Senator Macauley?

450
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:58,367
那电邮写了些什么
What exactly did this email say?

451
00:20:58,368 --> 00:21:00,302
哦 就是些
Oh, just something like,

452
00:21:00,303 --> 00:21:03,005
参议员说 谢谢你 伙计
the senator says, 'thanks, buddy.'

453
00:21:03,006 --> 00:21:04,874
这罪名很难成立
Well, that's hardly incriminating.

454
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,809
来源处应该还会有更多证据吧
There's probably more where that came from.

455
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,645
我很能编的
I'm getting really good at dacting.

456
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:11,247
你是指不胡编乱造吗
Do you mean un-redacting?

457
00:21:11,248 --> 00:21:14,484
洗去污点 对 对
- Taking the black off. - Yeah, yeah.

458
00:21:14,485 --> 00:21:17,086
嘿 这白痴可以跟我们自杀合约的
Hey, so goofball here can get in on the suicide pact.

459
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:19,056
棒 越多越好
Well, great. The more the merrier.

460
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:21,425
组团自杀
Team Suicide.

461
00:21:21,426 --> 00:21:24,996
你那个Hartigan自杀合约最后怎样了
So what happened with your Hartigan suicide pact?

462
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:28,033
哦 我们集体被炒了
Oh, we got fired.

463
00:21:28,034 --> 00:21:30,602
好了 小猫咪们 浸猪笼时间到 来吧
Okay, kittens. Time to get drowned. Let's go.

464
00:21:30,603 --> 00:21:32,538
女士 好
- Ma'am. - Yeah.

465
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,508
Gary 今天午餐时间 你跟Selina去了哪
Gary, where were you and Selina at lunchtime today?

466
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,310
我家 这不符合规章制度
- We were at my place. - That's not protocol.

467
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:42,080
我们就是这种关系 不要羡慕嫉妒恨哦 Sue
Don't be jealous that we've taken that step, Sue.

468
00:21:42,081 --> 00:21:43,481
我跟她的关系更亲密
I'm closer to her than you are.

469
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:45,015
什么
What?

470
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:46,516
Gary 这不是比赛
Gary, this is not a competition.

471
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:48,418
晚了 她穿几号鞋
Too late. What's her shoe size?

472
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:51,087
七号 七号半
Seven. - Seven And a half.

473
00:21:51,088 --> 00:21:52,889
好吧 她最不想看到的两个堂亲戚是谁
Okay, who are the two cousins she never wants to see?

474
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,393
Beverly和Michael
Beverly and Michael.

475
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:58,062
走狗屎运 事实在这里 Sue
- Oh, got lucky there. - Here's the deal, Sue.

476
00:21:58,063 --> 00:21:59,998
你不会赢的 知道吗
You can't win, all right?

477
00:21:59,999 --> 00:22:02,567
我是绝对可靠的 了解么
Basically, I'm infallible, okay?

478
00:22:02,568 --> 00:22:06,472
比如带着工作证去帮副总统买验孕棒吗
Like when you bought pregnancy tests for the veep wearing your staff ID?

479
00:22:08,141 --> 00:22:09,909
这样可靠吗 Gary
Infallible like that, Gary?

480
00:22:11,946 --> 00:22:14,948
Gary 华盛顿邮报一个员工告诉我的
Gary, look, a staffer at the Post told me.

481
00:22:14,949 --> 00:22:18,384
药店那个人看见了你的证 说给了媒体听
The guy at the drugstore saw the badge and sold the story.

482
00:22:18,385 --> 00:22:21,421
对不起 Gary
Sorry, Gary.

483
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:24,157
也就是说 只要一个人走了 我们三个都走
Which is why if one of us goes, we all go.

484
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:30,130
嗯 好吧 那你们都...
Huh. Okay. Then you're all...

485
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,932
也就是说那只是个假设
Which is why that was just a hypothetical.

486
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:35,769
这个词用得好 Mike
That's the exact word that I'd use for this, Mike.

487
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,737
悲 剧
High-pathetic.

488
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:41,407
Dan 你是不是要告诉我 如果我要炒这俩白痴里的一个
Dan, are you telling me that if I fired either one of these bozos,

489
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,742
你就辞职? 不会 女士
- you would have resigned? - No, ma'am.

490
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:46,320
我从未承认这个方案
I was never really committed to this as an idea.

491
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,621
是吧
Right, yeah.

492
00:22:47,622 --> 00:22:49,280
这是个巨大的错误 可以说是个笑话
This was a big mistake. Kind of a joke, really.

493
00:22:49,281 --> 00:22:51,549
谢谢你们啊
Thanks, guys.

494
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:55,619
Mike 你都说不清自杀合约是什么
Mike, you can't even announce a suicide pact correctly.

495
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:58,288
因为Dan说得太快了
Dan folded pretty quick.

496
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,658
进来
Yeah, come in.

497
00:23:02,194 --> 00:23:04,228
哦 Gary 我需要雅维 (解热镇痛药)
Oh, Gary, I need advil.

498
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,297
我的头大片大片地疼
I've got a headache the size of Nebraska.

499
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:10,300
我可能做不了了 女士 这是什么
- I'm afraid I can't do that, ma'am. - What is this?

500
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:13,437
我爱生活 更热爱这份工作
I have loved this job more than I've loved life itself.

501
00:23:13,438 --> 00:23:16,006
嗯 因为它就等同于我的生活
- Uh-huh. - Well, equally, 'cause it's been my life.

502
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:18,976
我对你的感情... 好了
And my feelings for you... - Okay.

503
00:23:18,977 --> 00:23:20,511
Gary 这是什么
Gary, what is this?

504
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:22,347
是我的辞呈
It's my letter of resignation.

505
00:23:22,348 --> 00:23:24,516
Gary 别这样
Okay, Gary, come on.

506
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:25,984
就因为你戴着工作证去药店?
Is this because your pass was seen at the drugstore?

507
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:29,722
你知道了? 所以怀孕的事才会被流出去?
you knew? - is that How The pregnancy story got out?

508
00:23:29,723 --> 00:23:32,424
我说真的 我不会放走
I mean, seriously. I am not gonna let go

509
00:23:32,425 --> 00:23:34,660
这个核心群里面
the one person in this core group

510
00:23:34,661 --> 00:23:36,895
唯一个能他妈帮我做点事的人
that actually gives a shit about me.

511
00:23:36,896 --> 00:23:39,264
好了 Gary 冷静点 我说...
Okay, Gary, get a hold of yourself. I mean, ser...

Who dumped Ted for me today. Thank you, by the way, for doing that.

513
00:23:42,201 --> 00:23:43,935
你真好 感谢你
- It was really nice of you. - You're welcome. - I appreciate that.

514
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:46,837
我的天 辞职必须拒绝
My God, resignation completely rejected, all right?

515
00:23:46,838 --> 00:23:49,306
你可以帮我拿些布洛芬吗 我是你的磐石
- Would you please get me some ibuprofen? - I'm your rock.

516
00:23:49,307 --> 00:23:51,075
好 但我想要布洛芬 好的
- Okay, but I need ibuprofen. - Okay.

517
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:55,613

我们要拿你怎么办呢
Um, what are we gonna do with you?

524
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:20,506
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

525
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,875
你应该知道我什么意思吧
I think you kind of know what it means, right?

526
00:24:23,977 --> 00:24:25,611
我们要怎么解决这个问题
How are we gonna fix this?

527
00:24:27,747 --> 00:24:30,014

呃 好
Um, okay, okay.

529
00:24:34,119 --> 00:24:36,421
我们可以写篇关于失去宝宝的文章
We could do a piece

530
00:24:36,422 --> 00:24:40,626
发表在一本有同情心的女性杂志上
in a sympathetic women's magazine about the loss of the baby.

531
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:44,163
争取些时间和信誉回来
Buy you some time and some goodwill.

532
00:24:44,164 --> 00:24:46,632
不行 你是对的 不能这么做
No, you're right. We can't do that.

533
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,868
Um...

534
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:56,476
要不然...
So why don't...

535

就说我们在你怀孕期间
we say some of us mishandled things

536
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:04,818
做错了事?
because you were pregnant?

537
00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:08,088
我是说...不 不 这主意不好
I mean... no, no. No, stupid idea.

538

可以说
Could say

541
00:25:16,231 --> 00:25:19,534
验孕棒是买给我的
the pregnancy test was for me.

542
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,940
哦 你的意思是 这就可以作为 你调走那个特工的原因?
Oh, you mean that would be why you reassigned the secret service guy?

543
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,344
因为你压力太大
'Cause you were feeling too much pressure.

544
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:32,113
有了小孩 之类的?
Baby on board. That kind of thing?

545
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:33,481
你是这个意思吗
Is that what you mean?

546
00:25:33,482 --> 00:25:36,050
对 我们可以这么说
Yeah, we could mention that.

547
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:38,820
好 终于像以前的Amy在讲话了
Okay, well, it's like the old Amy talking there.

548
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:42,957
我是说 我不能告诉你怎么做
I mean, I can't tell you what to do.

549
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,593
这是私事
It's kind of a personal thing.

550
00:25:45,594 --> 00:25:47,896
但你在想事情了 这是个好消息
But it's really good to hear you're thinking.

551
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:51,733
我要去拿点什么来止头痛
I need something for my head.

552
00:25:57,773 --> 00:25:59,707
外边流言满天飞
There have been rumors flying around

553
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,510
说副总统办公室有人怀孕了
about a pregnancy in the vice president's office.

对 我听说了 是啊

557
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,417
对 我流产了
Yes, I had a miscarriage.

558

哦 我很抱歉 嗯
- Oh, I'm so sorry. - Mmm.

559
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,856
就是想解释下当时的状态
I just wanted to explain the state of mind I was in

560
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:20,227
所以我才调走了Collins先生
when I made the decision to reassign Mr. Collins.

561
00:26:20,228 --> 00:26:22,962
这样 敲 敲 敲

有人爱吗 我不吃 你呢

566
00:26:31,003 --> 00:26:33,772
我不用 谢谢 没事

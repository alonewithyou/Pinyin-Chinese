- Am I all packed, Gary? - Yeah, we're all covered.

00:00:21,712 --> 00:00:24,680
俄亥俄的天气太你妈精神分裂了 -
The thing about Ohio is the weather is completely schizophrenic.

3
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,514
我明白 如果给你穿错了衣服的话
I know.  We dress you wrong,

4
00:00:26,515 --> 00:00:29,283
那你不是冻得像根冰棍就是热得像条狗
you're either freezing like a popsicle or you're sweating like a hog.

5
00:00:29,284 --> 00:00:32,318
或者说是像跳芭蕾舞或者现代舞的  好了 没关系的
Or a ballerina or modern dancer.  Okay, it's fine.

6
00:00:32,319 --> 00:00:34,653
这个地方有室内泳池么? 我带了游泳裤
Is there an indoor pool at this place? I packed my swimsuit.

7
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:37,155
你为什么问我这个? 还有我们有总统那边的消息吗?
Why are you asking me that? And have we heard from the president

8
00:00:37,156 --> 00:00:38,389
在经济论坛？
on the economic forum?

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:40,559
噢 有的 我才听说他打了高于标准杆三杆的成绩
Uh, yeah. Last I heard, he was three over par.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,295
哈?  噢 论坛取消了
Huh?  Oh, forum's not happening.

11
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:44,664
总统去打高尔夫去了 -
Potus took a golf day.

12
00:00:44,665 --> 00:00:45,998
你知道是谁和他一起去的么?
Do you know who he's playing golf with?

13
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,667
不知道 谁啊?  不 不 不 是谁?
No, who?  No, no, no, who?

00:00:48,668 --> 00:00:50,936
噢 是你不知道然后让我去打听
Oh, you don't know and you want me to find out.

15
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:53,105

Good to see you again, buddy. I miss your emails.

18
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,311
好久不抄件了啊 -
Long time no cc.

19
00:00:59,312 --> 00:01:00,479
你还在克利夫兰哈 Will?
Still up here in Cleveland, huh, Will?

20
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,048
你就在地方的猪圈里滚么?
Just rutting around with the regional swine?

21
00:01:03,049 --> 00:01:04,650
为Furlong当牛做马? -
Slaving away for Furlong?

22
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,218
呃 我现在是资深顾问了
Well, I am the senior advisor now.

23
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:08,953
所以我可以有免费无线网 还能经常去华盛顿
So I get free wi-fi. I'll be going to D.C. a lot more.

24
00:01:08,954 --> 00:01:11,122
我的天啊 凭着你州级的政治敏感度
Oh, my God. With that provincial sensibility

25
00:01:11,123 --> 00:01:13,123
还有这副娘味的样子 你是混不了多久的
and that girlish figure, you're not gonna last.

26
00:01:13,124 --> 00:01:16,125
听着 Dan 众议员希望你的老板为他竞选州长背书
Listen, Dan, the congressman expects your boss to endorse him for governor.

27
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:17,860
是的 我们知道这个事 -
Yeah, we're aware of that.

28
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:19,262
事情有点复杂 好吗?
It's gotten a bit complex, all right?

29
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:21,297
所以众议员要和你在房间里谈谈
So the congressman would like to speak with you in his room.

30
00:01:21,298 --> 00:01:23,599
跟我来 好吗?
If you'd just join me, okay?

31
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:30,340
啊 我认出你来了 你是Selina身边的小基人儿 对吧?
Ah, I recognize you. You're one of Selina's little gay dwarves, aren't you?

32
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,409
你是叫傻皮么? 还是嫩皮?  其实我的名字叫 Dan Egan
What, are you sappy? Is that it? Preppy?

33
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,077
你可能记得 事实上我曾经为Hayes众议员工作过
Actually, my name is Dan Egan.

34
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,013
天哪 我当然不记得了
You might remember, actually, I used to work for congresswoman Hayes.

35
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,982
听着 我需要你的帮助 哥们 我需要你回去告诉Selina
Oh, my gosh, of course I don't remember that.

36
00:01:38,983 --> 00:01:42,051
说我不要她给我参选州长背书了 好吗?
Listen, I need your help, buddy. I need you to go back and tell Selina

37
00:01:42,052 --> 00:01:44,153
她现在就和洗澡盆里的粑粑一样不招人待见
that I don't want her to endorse me for governor, okay?

38
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:46,355
呃 这可能有点问题
She's about as welcome here as a turd in a hot tub.

39
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:50,391
我们办的是筹款会 而她就是票房毒药 好吗?
Well, that could be a bit of an issue.

40
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:52,593
我们要把银盘子升级到金盘子
We're trying to run a fundraiser and she's kind of

41
00:01:57,865 --> 00:01:59,733
金盘子要升级到铂金盘子
gold plates are going up to platinum plates.

42
00:01:59,734 --> 00:02:02,069
我把Will装在乔治城的同志吧门口
I'd make more money if I installed Will here

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,105
作全天候欢迎菊挣的钱都比这个多
as a full-time glory hole greeter at a Georgetown gay bar.

44
00:02:05,106 --> 00:02:06,874
我十分肯定他已经在兼职干这个了
Which I'm pretty sure he already does part-time.

45
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,175
对吧 Will?  是的 先生
Right, Will?  Yes, sir.

46
00:02:08,176 --> 00:02:09,510
众议员先生 她现在已经在来这里的路上了
Congressman, she's on her way here right now.

47
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:11,879
那又怎么样? 在克利夫兰有大把事情可以做啊
So what? There's plenty to do here in Cleveland.

48
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,614
带她去摇滚名人堂好了
Send her to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

49
00:02:13,615 --> 00:02:15,316
我第一次带这孩子去的时候
First time I took this kid,

50
00:02:15,317 --> 00:02:18,453
他看了一眼Kurt Cobain的鞋就他妈疯狂了 (摇滚巨星 27岁去世)
one look at Kurt Cobain's shoes, he was bawling like a fucking baby.

51
00:02:18,454 --> 00:02:21,256
英年早逝啊!英年早逝啊!
It's too soon! It's too soon!

52
00:02:21,257 --> 00:02:25,426
女士 Martin Collins 就是那个被我们调走的特勤处的人...
Ma'am, Martin Collins, the secret service guy we reassigned...

53
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:27,862
嗯哼  他回来了 他被反调了
Mm-hmm.  He's back. He's been un-reassigned.

54
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,963
你玩我呢吧?  情况确实不咋地
Are you kidding me?  Not great, admittedly.

55
00:02:29,964 --> 00:02:33,366
确实不咋地? 对 这个就他妈应该是我回忆录的标题
Not great, admittedly? Yeah, that should be the title of my fucking memoir.

56
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:36,469
他不是就在门口吧 是吗? 噢 嗨...
He's not outside here, is he? Oh, hi!

57
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,071
我的个...! 好的 很好
Oh, my! Okay, great.

58
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:43,242
好吧 那是我这辈子愿意和他说的最后一句话了
All right, that's all I want to say to him for the rest of my life.

59
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:45,477
嘿 支持率出来了
Hey, approval ratings just came through.

60
00:02:45,478 --> 00:02:47,613
Oh.  66%.

61
00:02:47,614 --> 00:02:48,780
什么?  支持
What?  Approve.

62
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:50,849
噢!  对不起 是不支持
Oh!  Sorry, disapprove.

63
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,817
噢  不...
Oh.  Dis...

64
00:02:52,818 --> 00:02:56,320
你知道吗? 你去和安保人员一块坐去
You know what? You go ride with the security detail.

65
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,690
这车里没你的地儿了
There's no room for you in this car.

66
00:02:58,691 --> 00:03:00,359
她可以感谢军队啊
She can thank the troops,

67
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,993
她可以去迷倒随便什么二货
she can charm all the mouth-breathers,

68
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:04,530
她还可以回华盛顿嘛 没啥大不了的
and then she can go back to D.C. No big deal.

69
00:03:04,531 --> 00:03:06,532
她唯一不会做的事就是
The one thing she will not be doing

70
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:09,335
站出来为我背书 你懂了吗?
is standing up and endorsing me. You got me?

71
00:03:09,336 --> 00:03:12,404
如果我得到了她的支持的话
I get the stamp of approval from her,

72
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:14,640
那我就可能就得去找些狗崽来按到地上
and I might as well nail a bunch of puppies to the ground

73
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,976
然后用我的竞选大巴去压死它们 碾碎它们的脑袋
and then start running them over and crush their skulls with my campaign bus.

74
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:20,512
没有冒犯的意思 我们之前是...
All due respect, we did have a...

75
00:03:20,513 --> 00:03:24,850
达成了一个非正式的协议 要她来支持你竞选州长
informal understanding that she would endorse your run for governor.

76
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,818
好吧 没有冒犯的意思 傻逼
All right, well, all due respect, cock nugget,

77
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,353
现在这个非正式的协议
there's been a little too much of this

78
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:30,821
有点太萦绕不去了
informal understanding going on around here.

79
00:03:30,822 --> 00:03:33,057
对吧 Will?  是的 先生
Isn't that right, Will?  Yes, sir.

80
00:03:34,326 --> 00:03:36,827
绿色产业是你们办公室出品的吧?
Clean jobs was your office, right?

81
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:39,163
还有它在Macauley修正案里的角色
And its role in the Macauley amendment.

82
00:03:39,164 --> 00:03:41,600
让Macauley参议员违背总统意愿
Getting Senator Macauley to sneak in the VP's

83
00:03:41,601 --> 00:03:44,536
去偷偷提交副总统糟糕的法案
lame-ass legislation against the president's will.

84
00:03:44,537 --> 00:03:47,705
Macauley事件 那没有发生过
Macauley thing, yeah, that didn't happen.

85
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,608
Will 告诉他我是谁
Will, tell him who I am.

86
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:51,443
先生 你是国会监督委员会的副主席
Sir, you're the vice chair of the congressional oversight committee.

87
00:03:51,444 --> 00:03:53,946
而拥有这样的能力就意味着我有义务
And in that capacity, I have a duty to shine a light

88
00:03:53,947 --> 00:03:57,348
去曝光这种肮脏的幕后玩意 Dan
on any of this kind of backseat, finger-fucking insider bullshit, Dan.

89
00:03:57,349 --> 00:03:59,050
谢谢你花了这么多时间 众议员
Thank you for your time, congressman.

90
00:03:59,051 --> 00:04:02,186
我会尽力而为的
I will do what I can.

91
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:05,123
不许背书
Don't endorse.

92
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,926
她看起来挺好的
She seems nice.

93
00:04:11,029 --> 00:04:13,698
就因为那个笑面特勤人员 Amy
'Cause of that smiling secret service guy, Amy,

94
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,466
66%的人不支持啊
66% disapprove.

95
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,835
现在全美国也就这么多人醒着
That's everyone in America who's awake right now.

96
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:20,037
好吧 我们今天先不要关心那个
Okay, let's not concentrate on that today.

97
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,939
我们要集中精神在俄亥俄州
Let's concentrate on Ohio.

98
00:04:24,176 --> 00:04:26,912
怎么可能有这么多美国人不喜欢我?
How could that many Americans not like me?

99
00:04:26,913 --> 00:04:30,049
我觉得他们搞错了 他们数错了数什么之类的
I think they got it wrong. They counted those numbers wrong or something.

100
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,652
要不就是所有那些美国人都错了
Or all those Americans are completely wrong.

101
00:04:32,653 --> 00:04:35,622
好了 这是酒店经理 我们答应他可以有四秒钟
Okay, this is the hotel manager. We promised him four seconds.

102
00:04:35,623 --> 00:04:38,158
副总统女士 欢迎来到我们酒店
Madam Vice President. Welcome to our hotel.

103
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,694
我们得把副总统带走了 很抱歉
We have to take the vice president away. Apologies.

104
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:43,263
为什么要给我这杯猪血?
Why have I been given this pig's blood?

105
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:46,434
那是番茄汁 是俄亥俄的招牌饮品
It's tomato juice. It's the Ohio state beverage.

106
00:04:46,435 --> 00:04:48,736
我去 呃...女士  什么?
Oh, piss. Ma'am.  Yeah?

107
00:04:48,737 --> 00:04:51,406
他们那个大额捐款的票卖不出去
They're having trouble moving big donor tickets.

108
00:04:51,407 --> 00:04:52,607
什么?  是的
What?  Yeah.

109
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,342
为什么? 因为我吗?  不是的
Why? Because of me?  No.

110
00:04:54,343 --> 00:04:57,479
Amy 你得着手让大家都喜欢我
Amy, you're gonna have to start getting everyone to like me.

111
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,815
女士 有好消息
Ma'am. Hi. Good news.

112
00:04:59,816 --> 00:05:02,451
我们没有卖出去太多铂金票 -
We are not exactly selling that many platinum level tickets.

113
00:05:02,452 --> 00:05:03,919
我已经说过了
I just gave her that news.

114
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,756
但是后面的这条消息会更让你郁闷的
Yeah, but it was so much more depressing coming out of you.

115
00:05:06,757 --> 00:05:09,459
别担心 我有对策
Not to worry. I have a strategy.

116
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:12,395
好了 听着 我们该笑笑 该握手握手
Okay, look, we smile the smiles, we shake the hands,

117
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:15,899
但是我们不能背书 我们不让媒体有材料报道
but we do not endorse. We give the press nothing to report.

118
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,801
不 那样显得我更弱了
No, that makes me look even weaker.

119
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:20,003
好吧 女士 我...  嘿
All right, ma'am, I...  Hey.

120
00:05:20,004 --> 00:05:22,205
我真觉得这事值得考虑
I really think this is something to consider.

121
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:24,374
Jonah.

122
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,076
这是来自权力俱乐部的问候 Amy
Greetings from the clubhouse of power, Amy.

123
00:05:26,077 --> 00:05:28,244
你要知道 白宫明白最近的民意调查数字
You need to know that the White House understands

124
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,780
意味着副总统有多毒
just how toxic the veep is after these latest numbers.

125
00:05:30,781 --> 00:05:32,415
这是道难关 我们知道
It's a tough time, we're aware.

126
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,483
你想知道她毒性有多强么 Amy?
Do you want to know how toxic she is, Amy?

127
00:05:34,484 --> 00:05:38,487
你想象一下从死牛屁眼里爬出来的小东西
Imagine something small has crawled up a dead cow's ass.

128
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:41,524
然后这个小东西还死了
And then that small thing actually dies itself.

129
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:44,995
这个死掉的小玩意还放了一堆蛋出来
If that dead thing then farted out a sack of eggs,

130
00:05:44,996 --> 00:05:47,398
而这每一个蛋里
but each individual egg

131
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:50,134
都有一个更小的烂了的死东西
is a smaller, rotting dead thing,

132
00:05:50,135 --> 00:05:52,103
她现在就有这么毒
that's how toxic she is.

133
00:05:52,104 --> 00:05:53,805
好了 谢谢你的资讯
Okay, thanks for the input.

134
00:05:53,806 --> 00:05:55,941
而且我知道你现在压力很大
And I know you're under a lot of pressure over there,

135
00:05:55,942 --> 00:05:58,010
如果你需要个肩膀靠着哭或者是要约炮什么的
so if you ever need a shoulder to cry on

136
00:05:58,011 --> 00:06:01,046
你有我电话的哈...
or a booty to call on, you have my number...

137
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:05,751
你知道总统是和谁打高尔夫了么?
Did you find out who the president's playing golf with?

138
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:08,787
高尔夫 就是男人们带着棍子到处走
Golf. You know, men walking around with sticks

听着 我看了你的支持率数字
Listen, I've seen the disapproval numbers.

152
00:06:38,186 --> 00:06:41,122
所以我明白这里的微妙局势
So I appreciate the delicate situation here.

153
00:06:41,123 --> 00:06:43,925
呃 只是工作的一部分而已
Uh, just part of the job.

154
00:06:43,926 --> 00:06:45,694
不 不是的 这是Will
No, it's not. This is Will.

155
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:47,329
Will 他们对支持率的评价是什么?
Will, what were they saying about the disapproval?

156
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,499
对不起 女士 网上都写的是菊花被完爆
Apologies, ma'am. Effed in the b-hole across all networks.

157
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,302
女士 这可是挥之不去的画面感 我跟你说
Ma'am, that is a lingering image to try to overcome, I'll tell you.

158
00:06:53,303 --> 00:06:55,004
这是什么意思 众议员?
What's this about, congressman?

159
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:58,107
呃 我是希望...女士...我们能谈谈
Well, I was hoping maybe, ma'am, we could have a moment.

女士 我不希望你这次为我竞选州长背书
Ma'am, I don't want you to endorse my run for governor at this time.

162
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:10,452
呃 Roger
Um, well, Roger,

163
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:13,889
这个对我很难...  嗯哼
that is difficult...  Mm-hmm.

164
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,459
我都已经到这里来了
For me because I'm here.

165
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,395
是的 这很好 能给我来点水吗?
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's great. Can I get some water?

166
00:07:20,396 --> 00:07:21,696
对我来说...
Um, it's being put to me...

167
00:07:21,697 --> 00:07:24,232
Gary 能给我来点水吗?  好的
Gary, can I get some water?  Yeah.

168
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:27,336
对我来说...我很抱歉...
It's being put to me that... and I apologize...

169
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:30,872
但是从政治角度而言 你就是残次品啊
but politically speaking, you are damaged goods.

170
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:32,874
我听说你的信用已经降到了...
I'm hearing that your credibility is...

171
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,409
降到哪了来着 Will?  马桶里
Where is it located, Will?  The toilet.

172
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,279
嗯哼 不是我的话哈
Mm-hmm. Again, not my words.

173
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,981
所以...  马桶里?
so...  The toilet?

174
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:42,517
我不要这个  好的
I don't want this.  Okay.

175
00:07:42,518 --> 00:07:45,186
更确切的说 是上大号的地方  你是谁?
More accurately, the crapper.  Who are you?

176
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:47,956
这个菜鸟他妈是谁?  谁也不是
Who is this fucking infant?  No one.

177
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:51,893
我跟你说清楚 Roger
Let me be very clear with you about something, okay, Roger?

178
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:54,730
我都不喜欢你
I don't even like you.

179
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,298
对  对吧?
right.  Right?

180
00:07:56,299 --> 00:08:00,902
现在我...被告知要来为你背书
And now I'm, you know, been told to come here and endorse you.

181
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:02,771
所以你明白会有多尴尬吗?
So do you understand how embarrassing

182
00:08:02,772 --> 00:08:04,672
我现在如果不给你背书的话
this would be for me now not to endorse you?

183
00:08:04,673 --> 00:08:06,174
是的 当然 我明白
Yes, of course. I get it, yeah.

184
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:09,143
听着 女士 本着互惠精神而言
And listen, in the spirit of reciprocity, ma'am,

185
00:08:09,144 --> 00:08:12,013
我个人也不是很在乎你
I don't really care for you much either personally.

186
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:14,549
你不能阻止我给你背书
You can't stop me from endorsing you.

187
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,452
那我就公开拒绝你的支持 -
Then I will reject the endorsement publically.

188
00:08:17,453 --> 00:08:19,020
副总统女士 你要休息五分钟吗?
Madam Vice President, do you need five minutes?

189
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:20,521
不 我不用休息五分钟
No, I don't need five minutes.

190
00:08:20,522 --> 00:08:22,390
我他妈好得不得了
I'm absolutely fucking fine.

191
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:25,292
非常感谢
Thank you very much.

192
00:08:25,293 --> 00:08:29,163
Roger 你会不会有时候想到
You know, Roger, do you sometimes think about,

193
00:08:29,164 --> 00:08:32,166
我给你这个 你给我那个
I don't know, I give you this and you give me that

194
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:35,102
然后黑的上来 棕的下去什么的?
and black is up, but brown is down now?

195
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:36,804
你明白我的意思么?  嗯哼
do you know What I mean?  Mm-hmm.

196
00:08:36,805 --> 00:08:41,809
在生活中或者说仅是出于爱
I mean, in life or even just with love,

197
00:08:41,810 --> 00:08:45,145
我是说 归根结底
you know, I mean, at the end of the day,

198
00:08:45,146 --> 00:08:49,149
难道我们不都是...人么?
you know, aren't we just all finally just, you know, people?

199
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,485
说得对 女士  是的
True words, ma'am.  Yeah.

200
00:08:52,787 --> 00:08:54,187
你知道吗 我已经...
I mean, you know, I haven't...

201
00:08:54,188 --> 00:08:56,656
我已经有...三个月
I haven't seen my... my daughter

202
00:08:56,657 --> 00:08:58,891
没见过我女儿了
in, like, three months.

203
00:08:58,892 --> 00:09:01,627
而Ted就...哇!
And Ted is just, you know, whaa!

204
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:04,063
我不知道他去了哪 你知道吗?
I don't know where he went, you know?

205
00:09:04,064 --> 00:09:06,031
而我...
You know, and I would...

206
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:08,800
我很想去参加那场派对 你知道吗?
I would love to go to that party, you know?

207
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:12,838
我想到处都去
I would like to be everywhere.

208
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:18,243
听着 副总统女士 我很抱歉
Look, Madam Vice President, I'm sorry.

209
00:09:18,244 --> 00:09:20,312
我一点也不为此高兴 -
This doesn't give me any pleasure.

210
00:09:20,313 --> 00:09:22,148
不许说你没有高兴
Don't you say it gives you no pleasure.

211
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:23,482
任何人说这句话的意思
When anybody ever says that,

212
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:25,484
都是他们都特高兴
all they mean is that it does give them so much pleasure.

213
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:27,720
听着...  我知道那是什么意思
Look...  I know What that means.

214
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:29,689
也许你应该来一下 好吗?
Maybe you should make an address, okay?

215
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,626
说一些政治啊美国人团结起来啊之类的
Talk about politics and America working together.

216
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:35,028
我他妈知道怎么演讲
I know how to give a motherfucking speech.

217
00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:38,232
不许用你没有的下巴来戳我
Don't you patronize me with your no jaw.

218
00:09:38,233 --> 00:09:40,434
你个没下巴的众议员
You congressman no jaw.

219
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:42,903
好了 女士 我们该...我们必须走了
Okay, ma'am. We should... we have to go.

220
00:09:42,904 --> 00:09:45,072
都他妈滚  好的 好的
Get The Fuck out.  Okay. Okay.

221
00:09:50,245 --> 00:09:52,178
他不是个好人
He was just not a nice man.

222
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:54,181
我去给你泡杯茶 好吗?
I'll get you some tea, okay?

223
00:09:54,182 --> 00:09:57,550
我把Mike留下来 他可以留这里陪你
I'll just leave Mike. He can stay here with you.

224
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:06,158
非常抱歉你流了眼泪  是的
I'm sorry about your tears.  Yeah.

225
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,560
太逊了
They suck.

226
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,562
我爸爸曾经说过
You know, my papaw used to say,

227
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:12,665
暴风雨之前都会很黑暗的 所以...
it's always darkest before the storm. So...

228
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,435
噢 是黎明 是黎明之前
Oh, the dawn, the dawn.

229
00:10:15,436 --> 00:10:19,605
黎明之前总是最黑暗的  然后他就会亲我
It's always darkest before the dawn. And then he would kiss me.

230
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,241
好了 这个听起来可能有点疯狂 不过就这么办吧
All right, this might sound crazy, but go with it.

231
00:10:23,242 --> 00:10:26,378
她哭得很真实
Her crying was very authentic

232
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:28,780
而且很人性化
and humanizing.

233
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:31,116
好吧
Okay.

234
00:10:31,117 --> 00:10:33,118
我喜欢你的想法
I like your thinking.

235
00:10:33,119 --> 00:10:35,120
我其实觉得还有一点让人性致勃发 -
I actually found it slightly erotic, too.

236
00:10:35,121 --> 00:10:36,655
我收回刚才的话
I take it back.

237
00:10:36,656 --> 00:10:38,657
所以我才花了这么久才和Angie分手的
That's why it took me so long to split up with Angie.

238
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:40,592
她老是哭 我就老是硬
She'd always cry, I'd always get a hard-on.

239
00:10:40,593 --> 00:10:42,561
现在我被你绕晕了  听着
Now you've lost me.  Listen.

240
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,463
我们得商量一下这个
We should spitball on this, though.

241
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,500
玩哭泣大法
The crying game play, all right?

242
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:52,038
我们只需要设计她一下 然后让摄像机转起来
All we've got to do is set her up and let the cameras roll.

243
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:53,673
然后我们就捅她的泪点
Then we've just got to tweak the tear nipple.

244
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:55,775
我们怎么实施?
How do we make it happen?

245
00:10:55,776 --> 00:10:59,145
可以朝她喷胡椒喷雾
Could spray her with pepper spray.

246
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:01,747
说她胖 开玩笑的
Call her fat. Kidding.

247
00:11:03,249 --> 00:11:05,417
什么把她弄哭的?
What is it that made her cry?

248
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:07,352
是Catherine 对吧?
It's Catherine, right?

249
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:09,087
缺席母亲的刺痛
The absent mother blubber.

250
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:10,622
天才啊  对
Genius.  Yeah.

251
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:12,523
中式女儿的折磨 这个很不错 -
Chinese daughter torture. It's a good one.

252
00:11:12,524 --> 00:11:14,358
天哪 我不相信我们在做这个了
God, I can't believe we're doing this.

253
00:11:14,359 --> 00:11:17,328
另一方面来说 我们现在是在
On the other hand, we are currently polling lower than a side of beef

254
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:19,397
画了眼睛的牛肉旁边密谋 所以...
with eyes drawn on it, so...

255
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,532
好了 女士 又淡泡泡又多 好吗?  是的
Okay, ma'am, light and frothy.  Yeah.

Cappuccino politics, okay? Big three industries in Ohio...

257
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:27,171
橡胶  石化 农业  对的 好
Rubber, petrochemical, agriculture.  Right. Okay.

258
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:30,442
使劲说橡胶 这是个大橡胶州  好的 没问题
Hit rubber. It's a big rubber state.  Okay. Good. Yeah.

259
00:11:32,112 --> 00:11:35,147
那是什么? 传真件么? 还是你1988年写给自己的留言?
What is that, a fax? Is that a message to yourself from 1988?

260
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:37,116
你看是谁在和总统打高尔夫
Look who's playing golf with the president.

261
00:11:37,117 --> 00:11:39,218
Danny Chung.

262
00:11:39,219 --> 00:11:40,753
Chung  闭嘴
Chung.  Shut up.

263
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,755
那是什么?  别担心
What is that?  Don't worry about it.

264
00:11:42,756 --> 00:11:45,790
Felicia 等一下 你尽管问她女儿的事 好吗?
Felicia, one second. Feel free to dive right in on the daughter, okay?

265
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,959
因为我们希望你问支持率的问题
'Cause we want to hit these disapproval ratings head on.

266
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,828
看吧 他对我这么说话的时候 我就觉得很紧张
See, when he says things like that to me, it makes me anxious.

267
00:11:50,829 --> 00:11:54,131
我们刚知道Chung州长在和总统打高尔夫
We just found out that Governor Chung is golfing with potus.

268
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,133
所以如果你想提这个话头的话...  好的

Clean jobs initiative, dead in the water.

274
00:12:06,812 --> 00:12:09,548
你说了很多希望带来改变的话
You talk a lot about really wanting to be able to make change.

275
00:12:09,549 --> 00:12:11,583
你还觉得自己可以改变什么吗?
Do you still think you're gonna be able to make that happen?

276
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:13,752
当然了 是的 我为我们感到非常自豪
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, I'm very proud

277
00:12:13,753 --> 00:12:16,589
对于目前的成就
of what we've been able to achieve thus far.

278
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:18,157
那你感觉自己是重回游戏了么? -
So you feel you're back in the game?

279
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:20,893
呃 这对我来说可不是游戏
Well, it's not a game to me.

280
00:12:20,894 --> 00:12:24,263
而且流言肯定也让你很受伤
Must be very hurtful for you, too, with all the gossip going around.

281
00:12:24,264 --> 00:12:27,165
到底她会下台么? 我才知道
Is she gonna go? I just understand today

282
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,801
今天总统和Chung州长打高尔夫了
that the president is golfing with Governor Chung.

283
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:31,970
这个消息困扰到你了吗?
Does that bother you?

284
00:12:31,971 --> 00:12:34,472
总统
Well, I mean, the president

285
00:12:34,473 --> 00:12:38,376
想和谁打高尔夫都行
can play golf with whoever he likes.

286
00:12:38,377 --> 00:12:40,744
可我来这里是因为我有工作要做
But I'm here because I have work to do.

287
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:43,147
这是全年无休的 这是我的政治职责
It's 24/7. It's a public duty.

288
00:12:43,148 --> 00:12:45,782
全年无休那就是说没有多少时间 留给你的家人了?
24/7 doesn't leave you much time for your family,

289
00:12:45,783 --> 00:12:47,351
你女儿
your daughter...

290
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:50,387
呃 这是一个让人精疲力尽的日程 确实是这样
Well, I mean, it's a punishing schedule, that's for sure.

291
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:52,289
我是说 你会...你会累
I mean, you get... you get tired

292
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,025
而且会被...被打击
and you get knocked... knocked back.

293
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,828
但是...
But...

294
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:00,797
你能想象吗 Felicia
Can you imagine, Felicia,

295
00:13:00,798 --> 00:13:03,033
如果我累了的话
if I'm tired,

296
00:13:03,034 --> 00:13:07,905
想象一下俄亥俄州的橡胶工人有多累吧
imagine how tired the rubber makers are here in Ohio.

297
00:13:07,906 --> 00:13:09,907
她太牛逼了
She is magnificent.

298
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:13,745
日复一日的制作橡胶
Making rubber day in and day out.

299
00:13:13,746 --> 00:13:18,683
我觉得俄亥俄就是橡胶球之州
I feel that Ohio is the rubber ball state,

300
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,984
如果你仔细想想的话 它永远都会反弹回来
if you think about it.

301
00:13:20,985 --> 00:13:23,154
俄亥俄公民民主党筹款会
Always bouncing back.

302
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:28,792
我不知道她到底在想什么
I don't know what the hell she could have been thinking.

303
00:13:28,793 --> 00:13:30,928
你上一次一天哭两回是什么时候?
When was the last time you cried twice in one day?

304
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:33,497
比你想的要近多了
It was a little more recently than you'd think.

305
00:13:33,498 --> 00:13:35,500
Oddjob (007中的一个反派)
Oddjob.

306
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:38,002
过来 你老板他妈是搞什么?
Come here. What the fuck gives with your boss?

307
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:39,237
我看见她崩溃了
I saw the meltdown.

308
00:13:39,238 --> 00:13:42,552
众议员 我看到的是热情和信念
Congressman, I saw passion. I saw conviction.

309
00:13:42,553 --> 00:13:44,415
我看到的是他妈疯婆子
I saw a fucking crazy lady. That's what I saw.

310
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:47,579
如果她提到我名字的话 如果我得到了支持的话
If she mentions my name, if I get the stamp of approval,

311
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,349
要是她点石成屎的手敢懂我一下 我就冲着你来 朋友
the midas touch from Jenny shitfinger, I'm coming for you, pal.

312
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,785
我和美利坚国会会弄死你的 -
Me and the congress of the United States will get your ass.

313
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:54,086
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

314
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:57,223
去问问你的朋友Macauley 也许他能帮助你
Ask your buddy Macauley about it. Maybe he can help you.

315
00:13:57,224 --> 00:13:58,458
有请副总统
The vice president.

316
00:13:58,459 --> 00:14:01,794
你好! 是的 我看见你了
Hello! Yes. I see you.

317
00:14:01,795 --> 00:14:04,297
看看这些人啊
Oh, wow, look at this group.

318
00:14:04,298 --> 00:14:07,066
他们能在我之后活到投票的那天么?
Are they gonna live long enough to make it to election day,

319
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:08,834
也许不会
right behind me? Probably not.

320
00:14:08,835 --> 00:14:11,403
哈罗啊 不能投票的娃娃们
Hello, children who do not vote.

321
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,573
访谈的回馈很好
We're getting great media response to the interview.

322
00:14:14,574 --> 00:14:16,275
你也收到了吗?  不 更好
Are you getting this, too?  No, better.

323
00:14:16,276 --> 00:14:18,177
我在这房间里已经调查过了 很热情 很友好
I've been polling the room. It's warm, it's friendly.

324
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:20,112
如果这在俄亥俄管用 那全国都会买账的
If this plays in Ohio, it's gonna go national.

325
00:14:20,113 --> 00:14:21,447
来吧 Amy
Come on, Amy.

326
00:14:21,448 --> 00:14:23,783
Marcus  什么?
Marcus.  What?

327
00:14:23,784 --> 00:14:25,585
我做了一个蛋糕 上面有你的脸
I made you a cake with your face on it.

328
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,787
不是吧? 噢!
Are you kidding me? Oh!

329
00:14:27,788 --> 00:14:29,889
那看起来就像是我在参议院 度过了漫长一天的样子
That looks like me after a long day in the Senate.

330
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:32,825
我想她就捐了50块 -
I think she's only paid 50 bucks.

331
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:34,493
我得走了
I have to go.

332
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:36,228
副总统女士  什么?
Madam Vice President.  Yes?

333
00:14:36,229 --> 00:14:38,364
我要给你介绍一位真正的白金捐赠者
I'd like to introduce you to one of our actual platinum donors.

334
00:14:38,365 --> 00:14:41,533
我有一些关于税改的想法想和你聊聊
I have some great ideas about tax reform I want to talk to you about.

335
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:44,269
我很想听  呃 这世上有两种人
I want to hear them.  Well, there's two types of people.

336
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,639
啊哈  对吧? 有一种是抓取者
Uh-huh.  Okay? you got grabbers.

337
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,473
然后是另一种
And then you have the other kind.

338
00:14:48,474 --> 00:14:50,542
我没有给他们取名字 他们不抓东西
I don't have a name for that. The ones who don't grab.

339
00:14:50,543 --> 00:14:52,977
抓取者 好吧
Oh.  The grabbers, right,

340
00:14:52,978 --> 00:14:55,212
他们抓住世界的蛋蛋 好吗?
they take the world by the scrotum, okay?  Oh.

341
00:14:55,213 --> 00:14:57,982
而他们让事件发生  这个口味太重了
And they make It happen.  this is just riveting stuff.

342
00:14:57,983 --> 00:15:01,319
噢 对不起 对不起  什么?
Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry.  Yes?

343
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,856
我不知道要说什么 所以我就只好对你耳语了
I don't know what to say, so I'm just whispering instead.

344
00:15:03,857 --> 00:15:05,858
我这里有...
Oh, I have the...

345
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:08,661
中东的问题  你一会儿再说吧
Middle east.  you Can talk later.

346
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:11,932
我们还有一晚上呢  很感激 你好
We have All night.  I appreciate that. Hello. Uh-huh.

347
00:15:11,933 --> 00:15:13,700
我只是想离
I just want to eat in a quiet corner

348
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,769
这帮二货远远的
away from these bozos, okay?

349
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:18,305
找个安静的角落自己吃东西 好吗?
And that's the essence of a grabber.

350
00:15:18,306 --> 00:15:20,941
这就是抓取者的精髓
Okay?  Mm-hmm.

351
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:23,577
对吧?  嗯哼
You'd think with all the money I'm jerking up the wall here,

352
00:15:23,578 --> 00:15:25,179
你以为就凭我射在墙上的这些钱
I'd get more than a stuffed chicken breast.

353
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,081
我吃得会比夹心鸡胸肉强
Right, well, you know, I've got to tell you,

354
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:29,216
就是 我告诉你吧 这些承包伙食的啊...
these caterers, they've got...

355
00:15:29,217 --> 00:15:30,917
我捐了3万块 就换了一块鸡胸肉
I gave 30,000 bucks, I get a chicken breast.

356
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:33,053
那个人连500块也没捐 他也得了一块鸡胸肉
That guy didn't give 500 bucks, he's got a chicken breast.

357
00:15:33,054 --> 00:15:35,021
那我得的是什么 馅料么?  嗯哼
What do I get, stuffing?  Mm-hmm.

358
00:15:35,022 --> 00:15:37,824
好吧  给我来个鸡腿什么的啊
Okay.  Throw me a drumstick or something.

359
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:39,793
Larry  你好啊
Larry.  Hey.

360
00:15:39,794 --> 00:15:42,663
真高兴见到你  为啥 你惹上官司了?
It's good to see you.  Why, you need a lawyer?

361
00:15:44,198 --> 00:15:45,966
好吧 听着是这么回事儿
All right, look. Listen.

362
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:50,071
我可能惹上了点儿麻烦
I may have gotten involved in a little something.

363
00:15:50,072 --> 00:15:53,275
要是我被国会委员会质询了怎么办
What happens if I get called in before a congressional committee?

364
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:55,611
这样的话 你需要准备三个说辞
Okay, you need three versions of your statement.

365
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:58,347
类似我自己的版本 对方的版本 还有真实版本是吧?
Uh-huh, like what I say happened, what they say happened, and the truth?

366
00:15:58,348 --> 00:16:00,249
没错吧?
Right?

367
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,785
书面的 口头的 和一份简短的口头版本
A written, an oral, and a shorter oral

368
00:16:02,786 --> 00:16:04,620
有的时候会有时间限制  好吧
in case of a time limit.  right.

369
00:16:04,621 --> 00:16:07,089
国会委员会问问题你当然得说真话 Dan
Yeah, you want to tell a congressional committee the truth, Dan.

370
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,625
出点儿什么差错 你就会因作伪证被起诉
Anything out of line, you're looking at a perjury charge.

371
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:11,147
奶奶的! -
Fuck!

372
00:16:11,148 --> 00:16:12,962
别给自己惹麻烦 听见没?
Don't call attention to yourself, all right?

373
00:16:12,963 --> 00:16:15,698
就低调点儿小心行事
Just lay low, keep your head down.

374
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:19,369
好吧 那如果真的发生了
All right, now let's say this does actually happen

375
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,872
我被叫去质询 那是个什么情况啊
and I get called in, what's it like up there?

376
00:16:22,873 --> 00:16:26,242
你想像一下做梦梦见橄榄球队教练冲你发飙
You know those dreams where your football coach is screaming at you,

377
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:29,879
你就低着头 还穿的跟秀兰邓波尔似的 接下来就被打得就满地找牙了 想象得出不
you look down, you're dressed like Shirley Temple and then all your teeth fall out?

378
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,582
这个跟国会委员会比起来 简直是梦幻迪士尼
That's like a Disney version of a congressional committee.

379
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:35,618
你会经历各类问题 可能是温和的 也可能是严厉的拷问
You're gonna get hometown, downtown questions.

380
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,387
甚至遭到党派攻击 因为有人一定会哗众取宠
You'll catch partisan shit. There's gonna be grandstanding.

381
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,958
然后一旦他们尝到了甜头 他们就会觉得你不行了
And if they smell blood, if they think that you're going down

382
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,359
然后大肆攻击
and there's gonna be a kill,

383
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,696
你搞不好还会被鞭尸
you might get what we call corpse fucking.

384
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:48,532
老天爷啊 鞭尸?
Jesus. Corpse fucking?

385
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:50,567
就是就算你已经倒了 他们还会喋喋不休地攻击你
That's what it's called where they take your mortal remains

386
00:16:50,568 --> 00:16:52,369
并且乐在其中
and have as much fun with it as they can.

387
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,706
因为人人都想上电视 懂不?
'Cause everybody wants to be the guy getting the TV sound bite, okay?

388
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:57,107
他们会一直谈论你
And they're gonna be talking about you.

389
00:16:57,108 --> 00:16:58,209
懂了  好的
Yeah.  Yeah.

390
00:17:00,245 --> 00:17:02,346
谢谢你们
Thank you so much.

391
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:06,050
衷心感谢大家 各位晚上好
Thank you so, so, very, very much. Good evening, everyone.

392
00:17:06,051 --> 00:17:07,952
你干嘛呢? -
What are you doing?

393
00:17:07,953 --> 00:17:09,987
先生 这个流泪戏码大家很买账啊
Sir, this crying is tracking pretty well.

394
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,722
你说啥?
What?

395
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:13,991
哎呀妈啊  没错
Oh, shit.  Yeah, it's good.

396
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,392
这下大洗牌了 -
Okay, that changes everything.

397
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,427
她是一位你们都十分熟悉的人
She's someone I know you know very well.

398
00:17:17,428 --> 00:17:19,363
快过来  放松点儿 行不?
Hey, come here.  Relax, okay?

399
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:20,697
我跟她谈过了 你们也谈过了
I spoke to her. You spoke to her.

400
00:17:20,698 --> 00:17:21,898
她不可能背书支持你的
She's not gonna fucking endorse.

401
00:17:21,899 --> 00:17:23,667
不 不 不 她必须现在就背书
No, no, no. We want her to endorse now.

402
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,535
听懂没? 她已经从人人嫌变成人人爱了
Okay? She's gone from toxic to turn-on.

403
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,904
反正就等我们一点头 你就跟她放话 听懂没
So just... when we give you the nod, give her the signal, all right?

404
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,906
你俩现在搞得我胃灼热了都
You guys are burning a fucking hole through my stomach.

405
00:17:29,907 --> 00:17:31,875
我花了一下午时间按照你俩意思来
I just spent all afternoon fixing this for you.

406
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:34,611
结果现在可又不玩儿了?  你头一回遇到么?
Now you want me to unfix it?  is this your first day in The game?

407
00:17:34,612 --> 00:17:36,279
我看他好像快说完了...
I think he's wrapping up, so...

408
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,914
好吧  你感觉如何?
Okay.  How you feeling?

409
00:17:37,915 --> 00:17:41,617
这样啊 我是个政治上的麻风病人 情感上的定时炸弹
Well, I'm a political leper, and I'm an emotional time bomb.

410
00:17:41,618 --> 00:17:44,453
所以你猜怎么着... 咱上台吧
So here's an idea... let's put me onstage.

411
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:47,256
Selina Meyer.

412
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,762
女士们先生们 谢谢各位
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.

413
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:57,298
太美妙了 谢谢各位
So wonderful. Thank you.

414
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,401
请入座 谢谢各位 这是我...
Please be seated. Thank you so much. It is my very...

415
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:01,870
快点儿 你等啥呢? 快点儿给信号
Come on, what are you waiting for? Give her the signal.

416
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:03,539
啥信号啊?
What the fuck is the signal?

417
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,374
哪有什么国际通用的信号 能表达'快背书'的意思?
There's no international signal to endorse.

418
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,877
你他妈动点儿脑子啊 竖个大拇指啥的
Use your fucking head. Give her a thumbs up or something.

419
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,580
我的天啊 今天真是

Well, then get the hell out of my way, you leaning tower of...

563
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,977
比萨斜塔  不是
Pisa.  No.

564
00:24:06,978 --> 00:24:08,412
粑粑斜塔?  没错
Shit?  Good.

565
00:24:08,413 --> 00:24:09,780
赶紧的  好的先生
Move it.  Yes, sir.

566
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,282
小心肝儿 我要见副总统
Hey, sweet cakes. I need to get in to see the veep.

567
00:24:12,283 --> 00:24:14,718
议员 你再这么叫我一次 我就送你去急诊室
Congressman, if you call me that again, you'll need to see a paramedic.

568
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,020
交给你了  等会儿 等会儿!
Take care of that.  Whoa, whoa, whoa!

569
00:24:17,021 --> 00:24:18,955
混蛋 你在干嘛?  你以为我是个爱哭鬼么?
Big bully, what are you doing?  You think I'm a crybaby?

570
00:24:18,956 --> 00:24:20,690
抱歉叨扰 副总统女士
Sorry to barge in, Madam Vice President.

571
00:24:20,691 --> 00:24:25,395
是么 Larry 听着 Furlong在我办公室里
Yeah, Larry, listen. Furlong is in the office.

572
00:24:25,396 --> 00:24:28,399
别跟Furlong说话 你要保持低调
Don't talk to Furlong. You need to keep a low profile.

573
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,168
我刚发了一份媒体声明说我升职了
I just issued a press release announcing my promotion.

574
00:24:31,169 --> 00:24:32,971
再见吧 Dan
Bye, Dan.

575
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:36,542
说实话 女士 我很生气 Wil 跟她解释一下
Frankly, ma'am, I'm angry. Will, tell her why.

576
00:24:36,543 --> 00:24:38,644
媒体说你刻意演哭戏
The press claims that you intentionally cried

577
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,579
为的是掩盖
in order to divert attention away from the fact

578
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,881
我们强迫群众参与募捐会这个事实
that we had to bus people into the fundraiser.

579
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:45,484
现在我不想被你这些谎言牵连
And now I'm being implicated in your disgusting little lies,

580
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:48,754
而且说句实在的 我可不愿意蹚你这浑水
and, actually, I don't feel like being dragged into the toilet with you, ma'am.

581
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:51,856
首先 议员先生
Number one, congressman,

582
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,425
我已经受够你这些屁话了
I'm sick of taking your shit, okay?

583
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:58,263
其次 第一条再次强调一遍
Number two, number one again.

584
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,199
哭是演出来的 我是被操纵的
The crying was manipulated, ma'am. I was manipulated.

585
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,367
这个会议也该截止了
And this meeting is now terminated

586
00:25:02,368 --> 00:25:05,070
因为这压根儿就不应该被提上日程
because this was never a meeting to even begin with.

587
00:25:05,071 --> 00:25:06,971
你该走了
You're gonna need to leave 'cause I'm not really aware

588
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:08,573
要不我不客气了
of where my actions will take me, okay?

589
00:25:08,574 --> 00:25:10,909
你干嘛? 用内裤勒死我?
What are you gonna do? You gonna choke me with some spanx?

590
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,979
你想试试?
Do you want to try me?

591
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,182
你包里有口气清新剂没? 走吧
You got breath mints in that bag? Let's go.

592
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:19,852
你眉心有个红点啊 Danno
Oh, you got a nice big red dot in the middle of your forehead, Danno.

593
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,886
你被瞄上了我告诉你  你说啥?
And it ain't a fucking bindi.  Excuse me?

594
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,923
你最好装备起来 牛仔 因为我要对这间办公室
You'd better saddle up, cowgirl, 'cause I'm gonna ride this whole office

595
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:26,825
展开国会调查听证
into a congressional investigative hearing

596
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,461
听证项目是Macauley修正案和纵容下属腐败 -
over the Macauley amendment and the attendant corruption.

597
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:31,023
放轻松
Just relax.

598
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:32,898
我觉得你应该去整一个头盔
I think you might want to get yourself a helmet, okay.

599
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,967
再加上个防弹背心和下体铁护身
And a bulletproof vest and an iron jockstrap.

600
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:39,637
因为我会找人爆你头 捅你背 让你蛋碎
'Cause you're gonna get your head shot, your back stabbed, and your nuts danced on.

601
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,006
周一愉快
Have a good Monday.

602
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:43,540
再见 Sue
Bye, Sue.

603
00:25:45,576 --> 00:25:48,545
你暂时别升职了
All right, you're gonna need to stay in your former position.

604
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,714
好么? 保持低调
Okay? Keep a low profile.

605
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,616
瞧好了 Dan 爽!
In your face, Dan. Mmm!

606
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:57,687
我貌似已经发了一条新闻稿
Um, ma'am, I may have already issued a press release

607
00:25:57,688 --> 00:26:00,357
关于我升职的  真的假的?
regarding my promotion.  Really?

608
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:03,727
那我能把你撤了不? 恐怕不行
Well, can I unpromote you? I don't think so.

609
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,328
他又成了我上司了? -
Is he my boss again?

610
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,731
头衔上是? 但你比他资深
Only in title, all right? You're still senior to him.

611
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,268
瞧好吧  够了?拜托 Mike
In your fucking face.  Stop it, okay? Please, Mike.

612
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:14,304
Dan 喝酒的事儿 再说了哈?
Hey, Dan, I'm gonna take a rain check on that beer, okay?

613
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:16,940
我滴神啊 这么着
Oh, my God in heaven. So, let's see.

614
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:19,209
我刚提的负责反驳的人选
The guy that I have just put in charge of rebutting

615
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,679
现在负责进行反驳
is now in charge of rebutting questions

616
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,581
就Macauley修正案问题
over the Macauley amendment,

617
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,183
如今看来是最不合适的人选
which is the very thing he should be nowhere near rebutting.

618
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:29,353
对吧?  我跟你提醒过的 夫人
Right?  I did warn you about him, ma'am.

619
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:32,056
好了 出去吧 Amy 快滚出去
Okay, get out, Amy. Get out of my office.

620
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,405
看见没 现在... 我真的要哭了
See, now... now I want to cry.

621
00:26:49,406 --> 00:26:52,374
可欲哭无泪啊
But I can't cry.

622
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:54,943
能给我杯茶不?  好的
Can I Get you a cup of tea? Okay.  Yeah.

623
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:59,414
你懂不懂 这工作折磨死我了
You know, I mean, this job has fucked me up so bad.

624
00:26:59,415 --> 00:27:02,385
我现在他妈连哭都哭不出来
Now I don't fucking know if I can cry anymore.

625
00:27:04,922 --> 00:27:08,725
我可不担心这个 夫人
I wouldn't worry about it, ma'am.

626
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:11,329
我是说 你只用干四年 所以...
I mean, you've only got four years of this, so...

627
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:14,633
恐怕得8年 万一咱连任了呢
Eight years, I guess, if we got reelected,

628
00:27:14,634 --> 00:27:16,034
很明显
obviously.

629
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,738
要竞选总统的话就是12年
12 if you run for president.

630
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,775
16年 总统再连任
16, two-term.

631
00:27:24,511 --> 00:27:27,046
你想想
So think about that.

632
00:27:40,561 --> 00:27:42,528
Egan 好吧? Dan Egan
Egan, all right? Dan Egan.

633
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,297
大写字母D的Dan
That's Dan with a capital D

634
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:46,732
然后他妈的听清了 Egan
and Egan with an open your fucking ears.

635
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,935
没错 耳朵的那个E
Yes, E as in ears.

636
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,838
好 我等着
Yeah, I'll hold.

637
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,975
Dan走人了以后把那桌子搬回来 成不?
When Dan goes home, I want that desk back here, okay?

638
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:00,145
不行 她很忙 明天也没空
No, she's busy. And tomorrow.

639
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:02,213
后天也不行
Well, that's tomorrow in the plural.

640
00:28:02,214 --> 00:28:04,216
哪天都不行
All of them.

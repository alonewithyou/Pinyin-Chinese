4
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,400
我们在创造历史 我们是第一个女性总统 对吗?
We're making history. We're thefirst woman president, right?

5
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,150
我是 你不是 Michael
Well, I am. You're not, Michael.

我看到你了
Oh, I see you.

8
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:41,310
"Gettin' Jiggy wit It" Will Smith的一首單曲

我会把那本Philip Roth的书还给你
I'm gonna get that Philip Roth book back to you.

11
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:45,140
我没有忘
I haven't forgotten about it.

12
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,200
天呐 我都听不到自己了
God, I can't even hear myself.

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,210
我在说话吗? 我自己很难听见自己
Am I talking? It's hard for me to hear me.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,720
谢谢你 议长先生
Thank you, Mr. Speaker,

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,880
副总统先生
Mr. Vice President,

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,420
各位国会议员
members of Congress,

17
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:01,120
我的美国同胞们
my fellow Americans.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,430
今天我首先...
I'd like to begin today...

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,900
想说几句话
by saying a few words.

20
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,570
演讲里最好有些内容
You know, some content would be nice in this speech.

21
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,540
这些只是噪音一样的屁话
This is just noise-shaped air.

22
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,270
我知道 而且她明天将会
I know, and she's reading it tomorrow

23
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:24,120
在观众面前大声朗读这玩意
out loud in front of an audience.

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:28,350
老大 你还在榨果汁?
Hi, boss. You're still juicing?

25
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,890
- 是的 - Mike想健康一点
- Yeah. - Mike trying to be healthy.

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,660
就像土豆试图吹口哨
It's like a potato trying to whistle.

27
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:32,860
Wendy和我说好了
Wendy and I made a deal.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,220
如果能坚持到50岁 我就再也不用吃水果
If I make it to 50, I can quit fruit for good.

29
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,770
你觉得昨天的草稿怎么样?
What did you think of the draft from last night?

30
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,490
总统说这个演讲太含糊了
POTUS says the speech is too vague.

31
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,460
我以为她希望含糊一点
I thought she wanted it vague.

32
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,070
我猜我们好的过头了
I guess we did too good a job.

33
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,090
所以我们还是不知道
So we still don't know

34
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,610
她在联席会议上的演讲要说些什么
what's going in her speech to the joint session.

35
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,440
我们要怎么办? 像搜索伴郎演讲一样谷歌这个么?
I mean, what do we do? Google it like a best man speech?

36
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,980
别急 船到桥头自然直
Relax, it'll come together.

37
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,190
我做通讯主管的
It always has with every president

38
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,540
每个总统都能搞定
I've been comm director for.

39
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:53,510
- 一共几个? - 这是第二个
- How many is that? - This would be my second.

40
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,250
实际上 Hughes总统在位时
And actually, it didn't always come together

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,280
并不是总能顺利搞定
with President Hughes.

42
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,210
我们失败过很多次
We had many failures.

43
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,450
我想我都习惯了
I guess I just got used to it.

44
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,670
太鼓舞人心了 老兄
Great pep talk, man.

45
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,970
夫人 Ben会将Amy的直邮计划
Ma'am, Ben is getting Amy's direct mail plans

46
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,620
拿给您批准
for you to approve

47
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,890
然后您将接受Ann James宣誓就职住房与城市发展部部长
then you meet the Attorney General re Chicago

48
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,260
之后会见芝加哥检察长
after you swear in Ann James as Housing Sec.

49
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,750
好的
Yep.

50
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,030
您有五个优先通话正在等待
You have five priority calls in a holding pattern,

51
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,630
您可以在摩尔多瓦和皮肤癌之间接听
which can happen between Moldova and skin cancer.

52
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,000
好的
Okay.

53
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,230
然后您可能能休息15分钟
And then you have a potential 15-minute break.

54
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,200
好的 期间我可以睡觉
All right, during which I can sleep

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,970
你把营养膏挤到我嘴里
and you can squeeze nutrient paste into my mouth.

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,700
别指望了 夫人
Don't count on it, ma'am.

57
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,980
刚才参加演习的美国战舰
US warship on exercises just collided

58
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,410
与希腊渔船相撞
with a Greek fishing boat.

59
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,640
两人死亡 夫人
Two fatalities, ma'am.

60
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,810
是的 将会有场盛大的希腊葬礼
Yeah, we're looking at a big, fat Greek funeral.

61
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,370
我将安排您发表声明 夫人
I'll arrange for you to make a statement, ma'am.

62
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,910
好的 因为我是总统了 看到没?
Yeah, 'cause I'm the president, see?

63
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,480
现在所有事都是我的错
Everything's my fault now.

64
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,290
我有时间与Jim、Dan和Mike谈话吗?
Hey, do I have time to talk to Jim and Dan and Mike?

65
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,290
- 没有 - 我想和他们谈话
- Uh, no, you don't. - I want to.

66
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,120
- 那您就可以 - 好的
- Then you can. - Right.

67
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,870
开场很好 关于Hughes
The opening's good... the stuff about Hughes

68
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,460
和第一夫人的东西 A部分
and FLOTUS, section A.

69
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,900
没有A 我们现在用数字编号
There isn't an A. We're numbering the sections.

70
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,160
- 是吗? -是的 我们都同意用数字
- We are? - We are. We agreed on numbers.

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,090
所以A部分现在是第一部分
So section A is now section one.

72
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,730
哈佛教育的好啊
Harvard education right there.

73
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,370
那是谁?
Hey, who is that?

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,200
我想是Chloe或者Ellie
Oh, I want to say Chloe or Ellie.

75
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,170
Alyy 不 Sally
Ally. No, Sally

76
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,770
这里有一万个年轻女人
There are a million young women around here

77
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,110
在我看来全都一模一样
and they all look exactly the same to me.

78
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,110
你这个十足的女性歧视者
You big lady racist.

79
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,480
各位 我有个主意
Hey, guys, I had an idea.

80
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,590
这里闻起来像波多黎各
Smells like Puerto Rico in here.

81
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,420
我在榨果汁
I'm juicing.

82
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,990
好吧
Oh, okay.

83
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,280
这个主意怎么样?
So how about this idea?

84
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,830
如果我们把Hughes总统
How about if we take the cut section

85
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,190
草案的削减部分
of the President Hughes draft

86
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,590
和我的“家庭第一”草案的增加开支部分
and we put it together with the spendy section

87
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,560
放在一起 怎么样?
of my Families First draft, right?

88
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,100
再加上母乳喂养的事
Plus with the breast-feeding business.

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,400
是 夫人
Yes, ma'am.

90
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,570
那是Mike11A1和Mike11A11文件
That's files Mike11A1 and Mike11A11.

91
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,200
- 那是我的编号 - 好的
- That's for my reference. - Okay.

92
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,270
夫人 他们还没发现三个失踪的登山者
Ma'am, they still haven't found the three missing hikers.

93
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,850
- Cathy会告诉您最新消息 - 哦 谢谢
- Cathy will keep you updated. - Oh, thank you.

94
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,090
- 那是谁? - Cathy是谁?
- Who is that? - Hey, who is Cathy?

95
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,690
我得走了
I've got to go.

96
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,020
好的 走吧
All right, come on.

97
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,420
那就是真正的美国总统
That was the actual President of the United States.

98
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,590
永远这么酷
It never stops being cool.

99
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,690
- 她叫我Mike - 那就是你的名字
- She calls me Mike. - That is your name.

100
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,330
当然我们还得谈到Hughes总统
Obviously we're gonna need to talk about President Hughes.

101
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,530
非常感谢 放轻松什么的
You know, thanks a million, take it easy.

102
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,870
但是要短一点
Let's just keep it short, though.

103
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,280
然后就加入我对未来的愿景
And then that's where we put in my vision for the future,

104
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,060
好吗?
okay?

105
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,530
现在先标记上“未来随便吧”
For now, just put a marker that just says "future whatever."

106
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,130
有个情报简报会议
It's just that I've got an intelligence briefing

107
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,700
我得参加 好吗?
that I've got to get to, okay?

108
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,640
我们应该排好优先顺序
Okay, you know what we should do is prioritize.

109
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,390
因为有削减、增加开支...
'Cause there's like the cutty and the spendy...

110
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,240
我同意
I agree.

111
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,540
人渣们
Suckas.

112
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,950
夫人 我不能陪您去这个情报简报会议
Hey, ma'am, I can't go in this intelligence briefing with you.

113
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,750
- 对 - 您需要什么吗?
- Right. - Is there anything that you need?

114
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,510
我有您要的荷兰眼药水
I got those Dutch eyedrops you requested.

115
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,480
不 我不需要你 Gary
No, I don't need you, Gary.

116
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,890
好的 我就觉得得问问 这是您的咖啡
Great. Great. I just thought I'd ask. Here's your coffee.

117
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,690
- 不用 - 好的
- No. - Okay.

118
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,260
夫人
Yeah, um, ma'am,

119
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,820
您考虑过
have you given any thought

120
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,330
让副总统参加这些会议吗?
to the vice president being at these meetings?

121
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,830
我不想让他像我当副总统时
You know, I mean, I wouldn't want him to have

122
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:45,060
有那些屎一样的经历
the shitty experience that I had as veep.

123
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,300
是的
No.

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,190
遗憾的是 总统已经定好要参加这个会议了
Unfortunately, the precedent has been set for this meeting,

125
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,030
所以我不想改变事情...
so I wouldn't want to go change things...

126
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,600
- 现在这种早期阶段不行 - 正是
- Not at this early stage. - Exactly. Right.

127
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,160
总统需要这个包
President needs the bag.

128
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,940
- 是是是 当然 - 她只需要这个包
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. - She only needs the bag.

129
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,970
没这么简单 嗨嗨 轻一点
Okay, it's not that simple. Hey, hey, hey, easy.

130
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,650
你拿得不对 你拿得不对
You're holding it wrong. You're holding it wrong.

131
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,120
姑娘们都哭了 皮条客快死了
Ladies be crying, pimps be dying.

132
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,680
Jonah Ryan来了
It's Jonah Ryan.

133
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,910
我就觉得听到一个小女孩的声音
Ah, I thought I heard a little girl's voice.

134
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,980
- 听得没错 - 你好 先生
- I was right. - Hello, sir.

135
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,050
跟我来 现在这里是男人帮了
Come with me. This is a man hang now.

136
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,560
不会再有润肤露和妇炎洁的恶臭了
It doesn't reek of moisturizer and vaginal spray anymore.

137
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,490
那还只是Dan的味道而已
And that was just Dan.

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,220
大个子 你这傻吊还好吗?
Hey, big guy. How's it hanging?

139
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,020
挺好 就像假丁日来到了色情地牢...
You know, pretty good. Like a strap-on in a porn dungeon...

140
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,790
坚如磐石 满是蜜汁
rock hard and coveredin pussy juice.

141
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,190
你喜欢吗? 我有一大堆黄段子
You like that? I got a ton of them.

142
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,090
- 再问我一次 - 嗨 你这傻吊还好吗?
- You can ask me again. - Hey, how's it hanging?

143
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,030
- 像个粗大的肉棍... - Ryan先生
- Like a fat meat fence post... - Mr. Ryan.

144
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,860
哦 副总统先生 您好
Oh, Mr. Vice President. Hello.

145
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,460
感谢您让我过来
Thank you for asking me to stop by.

146
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,930
你知道是谁打赢了战争吗?
You know who won the war?

147
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,770
我相信是... 我们?
I believe that we... we did?

148
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,570
不 不是前线的部队
No, not the grunts in the front.

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,710
是幕后的人们
It was the fellas behind the scenes.

150
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,100
情报人员 解密人员

绝对的 虐待循环继续进行
Oh, absolutely. Cycle of abuse continues.

156
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,090
就像天主教堂
Like the Catholic Church.

157
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
暗指教堂娈童,男孩们长大了又继续娈童

158
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,330
是的 或者阿肯色州的婚礼
Yeah, or an Arkansas wedding.

159
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,400
阿肯色州施行契约婚姻,结婚麻烦离婚也麻烦.无过错不得离婚

160
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,060
弯腰 击掌

- I'm sorry? - No, no, I'm kidding. We're buds.

168
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,060
但我是副总统的幕僚长
But I'm the vice president's chief of staff.

169
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,760
你跑来直接见他
You know, you came to see him directly,

170
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,220
我都不知道你要来
I didn't know you were coming.

- 好的 - 很高兴和你聊天
- Okay. - It was great talking to you.

185
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,640
我不想和Hughes的计划绑在一起
I don't want to be stuck with the Hughes plan.

186
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,140
一个死人的计划
Some dead guy's plan.

187
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,340
他还没死 夫人
Well, he's not dead, ma'am.

188
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,800
没 只是说起来很好玩
No. It's fun for me to say, though.

189
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,570
“家庭第一”的最新民意调查
What are the numbers here

190
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:32,880
数据怎么样?
in the latest polling on Families First, huh?

191
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,780
抚养孩子脱离贫困 帮助有工作的妈妈?
Raising kids out of poverty and helping working moms?

192
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,300
是的
Yeah.

193
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,210
因为某些原因 贫困的有工作的妈妈喜欢它
Poor working moms seem to love it for some reason.

194
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,050
但是她们只会通过手机投票
But they only ever vote with their phones,

195
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,910
通常是投给其他不会唱歌的贫困年轻妈妈
usually for other poor young moms who can't sing.

196
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,840
好吧 谢谢你们的数据 伙计们
All right, well, thank you for these numbers, guys.

197
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,850
- 谢谢你们 - 不用谢 总统女士
- Thank you. - You're welcome, Madam President.

198
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,720
但是 一定会有什么办法
But, I mean, there has got to be a way

199
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,390
能够完成削减 也能通过“家庭第一”提案
to have the cuts and have the Families First bill.

200
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,090
军队怎么样?
What about the military?

201
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,700
你们认为他们会支持更多的削减吗 ?
Would they go for more cuts, you think?

202
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,200
是的 我们只要弄个丁丁-拇指
Yeah, we just got to do a cock-thumb.

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
什么? 你说什么?丁丁-拇指?
What? What did you say? A cock-thumb?

204
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,940
- 是的 - 那是啥?
- Yeah. - What is that?

205
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,740
说就行了不要做给我看
Tell me, do not show me.

206
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,130
我们提出一个激进的军队削减提案...
Well, we propose a radical cut to the military...

207
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,010
切掉丁丁...
cutting off the cock...

208
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,340
参谋长联席会议反过来提出
the Joint Chiefs in turn propose

209
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,420
他们自己的更合理的削减...
their own more reasonable cut...

210
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:07,970
切掉拇指
cutting off the thumb.

211
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:10,210
也就是众所周知的讨价还价?
Commonly known as negotiating?

212
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,810
好吧 让我们丁丁-拇指
Okay, well, let's cock-thumb.

213
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,380
非常不喜欢这个词
I really don't care for that term.

214
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,950
- 总统夫人 - 嗯?
- Madam President. - Yeah?

215
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:19,420
印度总理寄给您这个
The Prime Minister of India has sent you this.

216
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,990
- 为什么? - 我没搞明白
- Why? - I can't really work it out,

217
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:23,820
但是我会安排时间让您感谢他
but I'll put in a time for you to thank him.

218
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,460
不 我不想放在那
No, I don't want that.

219
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,130
- 不要鸭子? - 不要
- No duck? - No.

220
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,130
鸭子去死吧
It's a dead duck.

221
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,830
总统夫人 会找到办法
Madam President, there will be a way

222
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,070
同时做到削减和增加开支
to do both of these things, cuts and spending.

223
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,750
我知道 你绝对可以同时做两个矛盾的事情
I know, you can absolutely do two contradictory things at once.

224
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,880
比如 我爱我母亲
For example, I love my mother,

225
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,670
但是我不得不送她去养老院
but I had to put her in a home.

226
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,950
而且如果我不去看她 其实对她更好
And it's actually better for her if I don't visit.

227
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,120
夫人 这项工作不会简单
Ma'am, this job will never be easy.

228
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,960
我还不知道 天呐
Man, don't I know it. Oh, my God.

229
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,690
我感觉我脑袋里有个仓鼠轮
I feel like I've got a hamster wheel in my head.

230
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,870
你知道那种感觉吗?
You know that feeling?

231
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,000
是的 您听说过那个理论 里根雇了欣克利（曾刺杀里根未遂）
Yeah. Did you ever hear the theory that Reagan hired Hinckley

232
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,800
以便能够在床上躺两周吗?
just so he could get two weeks in bed?

233
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,540
是的 我是信了
Yeah, I'd buy that.

234
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,000
好吧 我们要对参谋长联席会议“丁丁-拇指”
All right, so we'll cock-thumb the Joint Chiefs.

235
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,510
你觉得他们会如何提议?
What do you think they're gonna offer?

236
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,180
不知道 二三十亿吧
I don't know. Two, three billion.

237
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,870
也许卖掉一个没用的机场
You know, maybe sell off a useless airfield.

238
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,590
也许我们可以把阿富汗挂eBay上
Maybe we can put Afghanistan on eBay.

239
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,900
- 能卖个十块钱 - 是的 是的
- Get about 10 bucks for that. - Yeah. Yeah.

Cafferty先生想了解直邮广告计划
Mr. Cafferty wants to know our direct mail plans.

247
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,870
总统需要做决定

削减或者在“家庭”提案上增加开支

249
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:26,210

250
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,810
是的 但是这里的母鸡拒绝下蛋
Yeah, but where the chicken is just refusing to ovulate.

251
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,180
演讲里说什么?
What's in the speech?

252
00:09:31,210 --> 00:09:34,320
总统要削减赤字还是在“家庭”上增加开支?
Will the president cut the deficit or spend on families?

253
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,060
财政紧缩还是建游乐场?
Austerity or playgrounds?

254
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,520
（要为集会订乐队吗?）
她还在考虑各种可能
She's considering her options.

255
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,020
或者她根本没头绪
Or she doesn't have a clue.

256
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,930
我们承担不了落在后面
We cannot afford to fall behind.

我们和Chung难分高下

（另外 Mike McLintock也想和您通话）

这个包还给我的时候 跟我想的不一样

大部分会议我都没有安全级别

我从来没看过 但是我知道
I've never actually seen it, but as I understand,

398

那里有一幕他们就像这样走一列
there's a scene where they all walk in a row like this.

399
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,890
你认为他们会提议什么?
What do you think they're gonna offer us?

二十亿 三十 最多

去隔壁的藏书处
Are you sure you wouldn't be more comfortable

421
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,820

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,710
- 请你离开好吗? - 开玩笑呢

N620型潜艇没有任务

那是她的后备降落伞
I mean, that's her backup chute right there.

577
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,650
太好了 我们修改这个的时候 她读那个
Great, she reads that while we edit this.

578
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,690
- 好的 好的 - 我拿了她的眼镜
- Okay. Okay. - I have her glasses.

579
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,210
- 什么? - 我拿了她的眼镜
- What? - I've got her glasses.

580
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,620
你不应该拿
You should not have those.

581
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,630
你为什么要把总统弄瞎 Gary?
Why have you blinded the president, Gary?

582
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,520
它破坏了她裙子的线条...
They were ruining the line of her dress and...

583
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,500
- Walsh先生 - 没人比我更恨我自己了
- Mr. Walsh. - No one hates me more than I hate myself.

584
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,610
你搞砸了 快跑去礼堂
You're wrong there. You run into the chamber

585
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:14,560
给她送眼镜
and you give her the glasses

586
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,100
然后继续跑一直跳到海里
and you keep running until you hit the ocean.

587
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,300
快去 Gary 礼堂 现在
Go, Gary. Chamber, now.

588
00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:18,830
太晚了 她已经上讲台了
Too late, she's already at the podium.

589
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,540
我杀了她 我杀了她
Well, I've killed her. I've killed her, okay?

590
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,140
谢谢 议长先生...
Thank you, Mr. Speaker...

591
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:24,580
- 天啊 天啊 天啊 - 副总统先生
- God, God, God. - Mr. Vice President,

592
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:28,410
各位议员 我的美国同胞们
members of Congress, my fellow Americans.

593
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,170
今天我首先...
I'd like to begin today...

594
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,950
想说几句话
by saying a few words.

595
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,420
我想请大家花一点时间
I'd like to ask for some time to think

596
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,530
缅怀Hughes总统
about President Hughes

597
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,970
和前任第一夫人
and the former First Lady.

598
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,400
让我们... 我们花几分钟低下头
So let's... let's take a moment to bow our heads

599
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,900
怀念他们对这个伟大国家的贡献
and remember their contribution to this great nation.

600
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,800
他们还没死
They're not dead.

601
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:12,750
哈哈哈! 我搞定了! 我太牛逼了
Ha ha ha! I've done it! I rule so hard.

602
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,720
别停 给我U盘
Don't stop. Give me the USB.

603
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,260
妈的 我总是搞错
Oh, shit. I always get it wrong.

604
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:18,560
这是一半一半的机会 我从来没搞对过
It's a 50-50 chance. I never get the right side up.

605
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,640
上帝保佑他们 多好的人 多好的人
God bless them. What people, what people.

606
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:28,310
确确实实 没有语言 可以表达
There are literally no words.

607
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:30,680
快点 快点
Come on, come on. Hurry up.

608
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:33,210
人民想要知道我是谁
People want to know who I am

609
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,680
而我想告诉他们太多
and I want to tell them so much.

610
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,760
上线了 鹰眼已经注意到了
It is up and the eagle has noticed.

611
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:45,600
我的整个职业生涯刚才都从眼前闪过
My entire career just flashed before my eyes.

612
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,490
真是难以置信
It was incredibly impressive.

613
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,230
它的政府可靠的手中
That its government was in safe hands.

614
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,170
不 那是错的措辞...
No, that's...that's the wrong phrase.

615
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,380
嗯? 什么?

616
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,140
我想我把新东西
I think I put the new stuff

617
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:59,140
放在了Mike11A1 而不是Mike11A1A
in Mike11A1, not Mike11A1A.

618
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,710
也可能是反过来
But that could be the other way around.

619
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,410
这个版本还有占位符在里面
This version still has placeholders in it

620
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,680
下一部分只有"未来随便吧"
and the next section just says "future whatever."

621
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,300
所以今天我不想只谈现在
So today I don't just want to talk about the present.

622
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,390
我想说一说未来
I want to talk about the future.

623
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,390
无论什么将会发生...
Whatever we have in store...

624
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,000
我们都无法预知
cannot be known.

625
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:25,310
但是随着时间... 我们会知道
But given time, it... it can be understood.

626
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,570
过去也曾是未来
The past was once the future.

627
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,510
我要说 未来是未知的
The future is, I should say, unknown.

628
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,570
事实上 是不可知的
It is in fact unknowable.

629
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,650
她在唱爵士一样即兴创作
She's bebop speaking.

630
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,010
所以我邀请你们与我在站台见
So I'm asking you to meet me at the station

631
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,550
与我一起登上一列
and join me as we board a train

632
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,850
通往未来的列车
bound for a place called the future.

633
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,220
我讨厌爵士乐 但是这确实令人印象深刻
I detest jazz, but this is impressive.

634
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:53,660
而无论那个未来怎样 我们都已经准备好了
And we will be ready for that future whatever.

635
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,060
我快哭了 我都不知道我还能几乎能哭
I'm almost crying. I didn't know I could still almost do that.

636
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:05,330
但是现在... 但现在是时候拉远未来
But now... but now it's time to roll past the future

637
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,840
非常非常快地继续前进
to move on and do so very, very quickly.

638
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:12,020
当我们想到未来 我们想到孩子
When we think of what is to come, we think of our children.

639
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,170
哈哈 太棒了! 我们进入正轨了
Ha ha, superb! We're back on track.

640
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:15,680
演讲的剩下部分都没问题？
And the rest of the speech is okay?

641
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,050
- 是的 绝对的 - 好的 谢谢
- Yes. Absolutely. - Okay, thank you.

642
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,010
呃...不是
Uh... uh, no.

643
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,640
而当我们想到我们的孩子...
And when we think of our children...

644
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,610
我想这个版本还包含
I think this version still has

645
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:24,650
Hughes总统的老的增加开支计划
President Hughes' old spending plan in it.

646
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,790
我们将要投资六百亿美元
We will invest $60 billion dollors

647
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,790
建设新的N620型潜艇
in the new N620 submarine fleet.

648
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,460
该死
God damn it.

649
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:39,630
对这个至关重要的现代化防御系统
That's a further $10 billion-dollor-investment

650
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,940
增加一百亿美元投资
in this vital and modern defense system.

651
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,670
她刚宣布了一个死人的计划
Well, she just announced a dead guy's plan.

652
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,870
他还没他妈的死呢
He's not fucking dead.

653
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,540
你觉得她注意到了吗?
Do you think she noticed?

654
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,490
我想是的 Mike
I think so, Mike.

655
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,040
我他喵的读的是个什么鬼?
What the hell was I reading?

656
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,150
你们应该把潜艇削减去掉
You were supposed to take the submarine cuts out,

657
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:03,890
不是在它们身上多花一百亿
not spend an extra 10 billion on them.

658
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,350
现在 给我... Gary?
Now, give... Gary?

659
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:07,090
眼镜
Glasses.

660
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,630
好的
Yep.

661
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,740
我说 这个演讲
I mean, this speech

662
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:20,040
本来应该完美地定义我的任期
was supposed to perfectly define my presidency.

663
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,770
修一下好吗?
Okay, you want to fix these?

664
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,140
许多城市的孩子
Whole cities of children

665
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,040
本来可以免于贫困
were going to be saved from poverty.

666
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:31,700
现在不然 这些钱
Instead now, that money

667
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,980
将会用于建造过时的

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,850
金属的 巨大的 假丁日

669
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,720
你们知道不知道...
Do you have any idea what...

670
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:49,980
你们离我越远越好
You need to be far away from me.

671
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,250
滚出我的办公室
Get out of my office.

672
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,900
夫人 我知道您现在现在需要独处
Ma'am, I know you need to be alone right now.

673
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,900
只是这些签过的...
It's just that these sign-offs...

674
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,970
我就... 我就放在这
I'm just... I'll just leave 'em.

675
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,200

676
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,640
抱歉 夫人 您说不想被打扰

680
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,380

682
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,330

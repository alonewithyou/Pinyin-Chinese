1
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,840
我首先想说的是
I'd like to begin by saying

2
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,720
白宫媒体简报会

3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:23,050
今天大家关注的唯一焦点就是
there is only one thing on anybody's mind today...

4
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,770
总统主持了她的首次国际来访
The president's hosting of her first state visit.

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,940
在友好迎接了以色列总理到达白宫之后...
After welcoming the Israeli Prime Minister to the White House...

6
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,520
他染了胡子吗?
Did he dye his mustache?

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:31,940
以确保他们掌握了...
To ensure that they seize this...

8
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:34,190
我了个大槽 他染了胡子
Holy shit, he dyed his mustache.

9
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:37,070
面子工程啊 他是行政部门的脸面
It's vanity. He's the TV face of the administration.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,110
脸上粘了虾条似的
But he's glued Cheetos to that face.

11
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,990
以为自己扮张飞
He looks like Yosemite Sam.

12
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,990
是哦 还没人家的架势
Yeah, without the credibility.

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,200
下一步他就该把奶头染成小粉红了
He's gonna get his tits done next.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,250
- Sean? -今天是总统就职第33天
- Sean? - Today's the president's 33rd day in office.

15
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,710
她会比威廉·亨利·哈里森 那个有史以来任职最短的总统 干得久些么
She's outlasted William Henry Harrison, our shortest serving president.

16
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,750
(就任满一月病逝)

17
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,670
-她感觉怎么样? -她感觉好极了
- How's she feel about that? - She feels great,

18
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,380
和那个在就职演讲时染上了肺炎
unlike President Harrison who contracted pneumonia

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:00,220
就死了哈里森总统完全不同
during his inaugural address and died.

20
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,100
感谢各位
Thanks, ladies and gentlemen.

21
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,760
干得漂亮啊 Mike 火力全开啊
Nice work, Mike. You're on fire.

22
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,760
哦 不对 是你的胡子红似火
Nope, wait. It's your mustache.

23
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,270
我叫这个橘色幻梦（德国电子音乐先驱团体的名字）
I call it Tangerine Dream.

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,930
等会儿去喝点儿么
Hey, are we getting cocktails later?

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,690
啊 不行啊 我得回家
No, I can't. I've got to get home.

26
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:14,270
你...
You...

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,230
-你能想到我说这个吗? -不 喝酒咱最爱
- Can you imagine? - No. We love to drink.

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,740
所以 我们重点考虑是家庭第一提案的辩论环节
So our concern is debate time for Families First.

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,450
竞选会议 罗斯福室

30
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:24,240
规则委员会的朋友们需要被狠狠推一把
Our friends on the rules committee need a shove.

31
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,410
所以你想让我来管理白宫规则委员会
So you want me to rule the House rules committee.

32
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,200
对 我有信心 你就是能干这个的人
Yeah, if anyone can do this, Dan, I'm confident

33
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,410
或是那个我们雇来取代你位子的人也能干
you or the guy we hired to replace you can.

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,660
这次以色列来访真是让我激动啊
I am really excited about this Israeli visit.

35
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,250
今天是个好日子 伙计们
Gonna be a good day, guys.

36
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,750
中东 中容易
Middle East, middle easy.

37
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,670
我想谈一下晚宴摆件的问题
I'm a little concerned about the dinner centerpieces,

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,050
-因为我觉得他们...-随便啦
- 'cause I feel like they...- Whatever.

39
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,220
我在这儿维护世界和平呢 好吗?
I'm handling world peace, okay?

40
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,880
你只需要把那房间弄得漂漂亮亮的就成
You just go make the room pretty,

41
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,180
比如说 和那个畸形相反的东西
i.e., the opposite of that fucking monstrosity.

42
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,140
那啥玩意? 毕加索的大姨妈汹涌澎湃?
What is that? Picasso's heavy period?

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,850
-前总统喜欢这个 -所以他老婆想自杀么?
- President Hughes loved it. - Is that why his wife tried to kill herself?

44
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:56,270
我想这叫 一个男人菊吐三角
I think it's called "A Man Who Shits Triangles."

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,110
屁股里面塞着五角(大楼)已经够受的了
Bad enough having the Pentagon up your ass.

46
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,320
Amy哪去了?
Where is Amy, by the way?

47
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,450
她身为竞选经理 而这是个竞选大会
She's campaign manager, this is a campaign meeting.

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,660
我是说 我还要去拯救世界呢
I mean, I've got to go save the world.

49
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,620
我知道这听起来有点吹牛逼 但是
I know that sounds like hyperbole, but...

50
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:08,160
-但是你就是要去 -我就是要去拯救世界
- But you do. Yeah. - I do, in fact.

51
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,910
我还真是要去拯救世界呢
I actually do do have to do that.

52

我刚收到Amy的短信
I just got a text from Amy.

53
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,870
我会痴点
"I'm a latte"?

54
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,750
-啥? -猜她想说她会迟点
- Huh? - Guess she means she's late.

55
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,300
你还说不会堵车
You said there wouldn't be traffic.

56
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,170
-现在就堵车了 -是啊
- This is traffic. - Yep.

57
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,550
任何原因都有可能...交通事故啊 持枪乱扫啊
Could be anything... accident up ahead, active shooter.

58
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,510
估计不是那个吧
Well, probably not that.

59
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:31,180
你要是再敢害我迟到 我就把你锁在车里 再把这辆车压成小方块
You make me any more late, and I lock you in this car and have it compacted.

60
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,770
-来点音乐吧 -表
- How about some music? Hmm? - No.

61
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,190
我把你手机接上蓝牙了 所以..
I Bluetoothed your phone, so...

62
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,560
个人记事 我能赢
Memo to self... it is winnable.

63
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,150
-取消个人投票 - 我要把它关了
- Delete the private polling. - Oh, turn that off.

64
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,530
我想我连上音乐播放器了呢
I thought I had it on shuffle.

65
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,650
脱毛
Also, hair.

66
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,490

67
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,740
这次选举 整个宣传策略
The campaign, the whole comm strategy.

我们现在出了太多篓子了
We've got too many balls being dropped right now.

69

关于Catherine的可怕图片
appalling photograph of Catherine.

71
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,670
没有恶意啊亲爱的 但是你看看你这张脸
No offense, honey, but, I mean, look at yourself.

72
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,210
这不是我的错 这家媒体就把我当回事
It's not my fault. The press doesn't take me seriously

73
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,970
因为我在这儿没地位
because I don't have a role here.

74
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,680
我需要成为核心成员
I need a core role.

75
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,720
对 这是个非常好的主意
Yeah, that's a very good idea.

我觉得我穿越到未来了
I feel like I'm on trial in the future.

83
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:27,490
夫人 如果我能打断一下的话 我真的认为...
Ma'am, if I could interrupt. I really think that...

84
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,200
Amy啊 信号不好 你说一个字漏一个字呢
Uh, Amy, it's filtering out like every other word.

85
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,740
通常我自己这么干
Usually I just do that myself.

86
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,250
好的 所以我们需要Bill Ericsson来稳住大局
Okay, this is why we need asteady hand like Bill Ericsson.

87
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,130
顺便一提 我会让Bill Ericsson加入
By the way, I'm bringing in Bill Ericsson.

88
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,960
总统夫人 你刚刚是说Bill Ericsson吗?
Madam President, did you just say Bill Ericsson?

89
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,260
夫人 我..噢!

90
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,550
好了好了 真是不忍直视
Oh, okay, I can't look at that anymore.

91
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,390
看Mike的胡子已经够我受的了
It's bad enough looking at Mike's mustache.

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,800
你看到他的胡子了? 跟吃了个火山似得

98
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,150
Catherine是很有价值的成员
that I think that Catherine is a valuable asset.

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,740

100
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,990
但是她的受欢迎指数
But her likability index is...

101
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,200
非常之低
shallow.

102
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,370
啥?
What?

103
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,870
我们对她的欢迎程度进行了投票
We polled her popularity.

104

How could you have the audacity to...

106

这看起来不妙啊
Oh, these are not good.

108
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,890
好吧 得有人告诉她这个
Okay, well, she's gonna have to be told.

109
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,260
当然了 温柔点
Gently, of course.

110
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:35,770
但是谁去告诉她呢?
But who's going to do that?

111
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,190
-夫人 我相信我可以 -那就是你了

听说了 我听说你把它退了 让它装饰地狱去了
I did. I heard you sent them back to centerpiece hell.

161
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:39,310
就是说啊 我们觉得那就是不对头
I know. We felt they weren't right.

162
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,310
所以 这是总统的意见?
So this is coming from the president?

163

It's coming from us.

对 我们是这么想的
Yes, we do.

166
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,900
你说那个桌上摆件不对头
And when you say that the centerpieces are not right,

167
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,570
你能给我稍微说说
can you just give me a little indication

168
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,990
是怎么个不对头么
of what you mean when you say "not right"?

169
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,490
我们就是觉得吧 那需要有个不一样的形状
We just kind of feel like they need to be a different shape.

170
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,330
-要特别突出 -好的

All right, Richard, you need to hide Ben's Ativan

178
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,880
直到他把Bill Ericsson的事全坦白了
till he comes clean about Bill Ericsson.

179
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,760
-嗨 Amy -Bill 见..见到你真好啊
- Hi, Amy. - Bill, it... it's good to see you.

180
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,310

消除弱点

184
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,730
有点儿纳粹医生的感觉
That's a little Nazi doctor.

185
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,440
我是传媒部门的新领导
I'm the new director of communications.

186

你是新的竞选经理呢
you were the new campaign manager.

188
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,950
-嗯! -哦 不 我懂了 好的
- Mmm! - Oh, no. I get it. Okay.

189
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,370
好吧 我只是想用不那么友好的方式友好的打个招呼
Well, I just wanted to say a friendly hello in an unfriendly way.

190
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,910

总统女士 白宫的一幅画今天被移除了
Madam President, a painting in theWhite House was removed this morning.

201
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,820
所以我们就要躲去战情室了?
Should we go to the Situation Room?

202
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,450
这是整栋大楼里唯一的印第安人艺术品
It was the only work of art by a Native American artist in the building.

203
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,740
我是说 谁知道我们有那个啊
I mean, who knew we even had one?

204
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,950
那个画了些发癫的三角形的画
It was the crazy triangles painting.

205
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,740
印第安人觉得他们收到了怠慢
Native Americans are taking it as a slight, ma'am.

206
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,660
那就发个申明说我们只是把它送出去清洗
Then just issue a statement saying we had it sent out to be cleaned.

207
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,710
对了 让Bill Ericsson做这件事
Actually, have Bill Ericsson do that

208
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,920
因为我打算让Bill Ericsson取代你
because I'm having Bill Ericsson replace you.

209
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:33,670
-总统女士? -什么?

关于缩减封锁一致性可行性
Points of departure for the possible agreements

211
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,090

on the scale-down of blockades.

00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,760
那是谁?
Who is that?

213
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,180
老实说 我都不知道她是不是我们的人
To be honest, I don't even know if she's one of ours.

214
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,850
20刀打赌她叫Mossad 行了 我们只有4分钟了
20 bucks says she's Mossad. Come on, we've only got four minutes.

215
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,520
好 对不起 Jim 我没空
Okay. Sorry, Jim. I don't have time

216
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:48,810
来跟你解释我对那个的想法
to explain my thinking on that.

217
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,640
我脑子里都是中东的事呢
It's just I've got the Middle East in here.

218
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,610
即使我们有些观点不同
Even though we have our differences,

219
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,820
我认为我妈妈推动和平谈判这事
I think my mom brokering major peace talks

220
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,110
非常的了不起
is super awesome.

221
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,860
真的是 非常了不起
It is. Super awesome.

222
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,030
我想跟你谈些私人问题
But I want to talk to you about a more personal matter.

223
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,490
我没跟那些家伙吸毒
I didn't take drugs with those guys.

224
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,080
我只是在他们的大巴里呆了半个小时
I was just in their bus for half an hour.

225
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,960
知道也好
That is good to know.

226
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,090
这是Catherine Meyer形象品牌问题
This is about the brand image of Catherine Meyer, TM.

227
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,680
我让你来是因为
I asked you in because, um...

228
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,560
Catherine 美国不喜欢你
Catherine, America doesn't like you.

229
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,100
啥？
What?

230
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,560
这听起来太残酷了点
That sounded way too harsh

231
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,270
头版标题版的总结词
when boiled down to a headline thought.

232
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:35,440
-给我看看 -这并不代表你不讨人喜欢
- Let me see that. - It's not that you are unlikable.

233
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,110
只是一种观点说你不讨人喜欢
It's that there's a perception that you are unlikable.

234
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
他们恨我
They hate me.

235
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,620
我不会用恨这个词 你只是
I wouldn't say hate. You just...

236
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,660
两极化的观点 而这一头比较重
polarize opinion with the bulk of it gravitating to this pole here.

237
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:53,420
呃 哦 天啊
Uh... oh, my.

238
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,290
你肩膀挺削的
You have sharp shoulders.

239
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,920
这就像是高中重演
This is like high school all over again.

240
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,260
对 有点儿吧 规模更大了
Yeah, sure, kind of, but much bigger.

241
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:03,510
让我们来谈谈转变你的形象的问题吧
So let's talk about changing your narrative.

242
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,550
得到公众认可的捷径有
Customary shortcuts to public affirmation

243
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,930
服役或者生孩子
are military service or childbirth.

244
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:11,600
好吧 天啊 才不 老天爷啊 我才不 照你说的那样做
Okay, God, no, and, oh, my God, no, in that order.

245
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:13,560
好吧 让我们回到想办法转变
Okay, well, then we go back to the idea

246
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,480
这张苦脸
of turning that frown

247
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,860
成为不苦脸的问题上
into the inverse of a frown.

248
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,740
-扭转乾坤？ -如果你愿意的话
- Upside down? - If you will.

249
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,370
所以你从来都没有想过
So there wasn't even like a little part of you

250
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,080
我会加入谈话？
that thought I was gonna be in these talks?

251
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,210
好了 你看 你就坐在那里听我指挥
Okay, look, just sit there in the meeting and let me take the lead.

252
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,500
如果我需要你帮助 我会给你个信号
If I need your help, I'll give you a signal.

253
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,250
好 啥信号？
Okay, what's the signal?

254
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,960
没有啥信号 Jonah
There's not gonna be a signal, Jonah.

255
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,340
-嗨 - Pierce议员 见到你很高兴
- Hey. - Congressman Pierce, so good to see you.

256
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,550
嗨 小培根你抖个啥? 这是我打招呼的方式 活络下气氛
Hey, what's shakin', bacon? That's my way of saying hello, breaking the ice.

257
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,850
-天 见到你真好 -这是我同事
- God, it's good to see you. - This is my colleague.

258
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,970
-让我们开始吧 -好嘞
- But you know what? Let's get started. - Yeah.

259
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,480
我喜欢你的办公室 这真棒
I really like your office. This is a great office.

260
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:56,600
你布置家具的方式
The way you've arranged the furniture.

261
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,610
这个骑马的人 那个画
This horse guy over here, that painting.

262
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,860
这是我来过的最棒的办公室了
This is the nicest office I've ever been in.

263
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,280
我这位朋友挺兴奋的
My friend here is very excited here,

264
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,780
就好像我们都为这个家庭第一提案兴奋一样
as are we, obviously, about the Families First bill.

265
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,360
特别是 这个先期K计划
Specifically, the pre-K program

266
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,410
特别针对低收入家庭 我们极力推崇这部分
for low-income families. We're very proud of that.

267
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,030
我所代表的人民
Well, the people that I represent

268
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:15,000
喜欢看到钱花的很明智
like to see that money is spent wisely.

269
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,420
当然了 所以我们一直提倡不能穷教育
Of course, that's why we always say invest in education.

270
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,630
你懂得 不要只把他们当孩子
You know, don't think of them as kids

271
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,750
而要当成小人形创业公司
as much as little human start-ups.

272
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,630
你懂的 花钱即是存钱
You know, spend to save.

273
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,470
然后你就可以把你存的钱拿出来花了
And then you take the money you save and you spend it.

274
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,130
这就是经济学
That's economics.

275
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,050
好吧 在我的桌上
And, well, on my desk here,

276
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,850
你看我存了一盒优惠券
you see I keep a box of coupons.

277
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,100
我自己剪的哦
I clip them myself.

278
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,850
这时刻提醒我记得勤俭节约
And this is to help me to remember to be economical.

279
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:37,730
真是个好主意
That is a fantastic idea.

280
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,810
我这就记下来 我也要这么干
I'm gonna take a page. I'm gonna do this myself.

281
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,780
你知道这里面好些都过期了么
Did you know that a lot of these have expired?

282
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,990
对 我非常 特别忙...
Yeah, I'm so... It's so busy on the...

283
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,280
-我在忙规则委员会的事情 -当然了
- I'm on the rules committee now. - Of course.

284
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,830
所以你是说理论上你支持这项提案
So what you're saying is that you support the bill in principle,

285
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,410
但是会担心支出的增长
but you're worried that an escalation of cost

286
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,200
会让你白宫的同僚们不满意?
wouldn't sit well with your colleagues in the House?

287
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,370
恩..这 ..这总结的挺好
Mmm, that's... yeah, that's very well put.

288
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,040
-谢谢 -嗨 你喜欢打保龄球么?
- Thank you. - Hey, you like to bowl?

289
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,960
哦 我打的不好
Oh, I am a terrible bowler.

290
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,760
但是我特别喜欢用它做些社交活动
But I enjoy the social aspects immensely.

291
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:08,340
你知道吗 我们明天晚上有个小聚会
Well, you know, we're all getting together for a little hang

292
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,720
就在白宫保龄球馆
at the White House bowling alley tomorrow night.

293

294
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,180
和总统一起哦
with the President of the United States.

295
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,060
-那可是梦寐以求的保龄球 -我可没说她会...
- That's bucket list bowling. - I didn't mean that she would...

296
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:17,350
和总统一对一面谈那真是太棒了
A one-on-one with the president would be great.

297
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:20,150
-还有拍照 -你想要照片么
- And a photographic record of it... - You want to get a photo?

298
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,060
我们要确认一下日程安排 -不 我们来安排
- We'd have to check with the scheduler. - No, we got this.

299
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,770
她可能也打得不咋地
She's probably not a very good bowler.

300
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,190
你可能有机会打败她呢
You might even be able to beat her.

301
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:28,110
我们肯定有印第安裔的工作人员
We do have Native American staff.

302
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:30,610
他们就在名单里 你30分钟内给我找出来 明白?
They're on a list that you're gonna give me in 30 minutes, okay?

303
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,990
美国拓荒时期以印第安人头皮数量领赏金

304
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:33,700
现在给我弄点头皮 名字 弄点名字来
Now get me some scalps. Names. Get me some names.

305
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,870
嗨 伙计 我都不知道说什么好
Hey, buddy, I don't know what to say.

306
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,630
这工作是我的一切
This job's my whole life.

307
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,340
我本不想说 但是你能帮帮我么
Hey, I hate to ask, but would you mind helping me out?

308
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,090
你能告诉媒体 Bill Ericsson要取代你的工作么?
Would you tell the media that Bill Ericsson's taking your job?

309
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,390
这样看起来会比较友善啦
It would just make it seem more amicable.

310
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,970
你能为我做这个么
Would you do that for me?

311
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,360
不
No.

312
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,280
如果我们可以为对话定下个时间表
And if we could just agree to a timetable for the talks.

313
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,240
你们能想象么 我是说这就像是为和平之墙
Can you imagine that? I mean,it would be the first brick

314
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,990
-加上第一块砖 - 不是墙  夫人
- in the wall of peace. - It's not a wall, ma'am.

315
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,700
啊 就是个表达方式  我是想说 和平之桥
Well, it's an expression. A bridge of peace, I'll say.

316
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,870
就快要实现了 就快了
We're so close. We're so close.

317
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,120
所以就是连接我的国家和想摧毁它的人们的桥?
So is my country to lots of people who would like to destroy it.

318
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,580
呃...
Uh...

319
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,460
那些纸条是关于印第安油画的事么?
Are all these notes about the Native American painting?

320
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,880
你在这儿说什么侵略的事
Yes, it's ironic that you're talking to us about occupation

321
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,920
自己还霸着别人的大陆真是讽刺啊
while you occupy someone else's continent.

322
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,600
好 我明白你为啥说讽刺
Yeah, okay. Well, I do see the irony in that.

323
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,680
不好意思 就一会儿 不好意思
Excuse me just two seconds. I'm sorry. Pardon me.

324
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:42,140
-嗨 -是关于画的
- Hi. - It's about the painting.

325
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,730
好 你看到我后面正发生什么事了么?
Okay, you see what's going on over here behind me?

326
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,860
-摊上大事了 -对
- Kind of a big deal. - Yeah.

327
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,530
为啥你不告诉印第安小朋友
So why don't you tell Sacheen Littlefeather

328
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,360
闭上嘴别bb这事儿就这么算了 好吗
to get off the rag and get over it, all right?

329
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:53,740
-好的 -还有我从来没说过刚才那些话
- Okay. - And I never said that.

330
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,700
-好的 -好的
- Right. - Right. Okay.

331
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,200
再次重申 那幅油画并未被移走
To reiterate, the painting was not removed.

332
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,250
只是被拿出去做清洁了
It was just taken out to be cleaned.

333
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,790
那是四年前才画的 怎么弄脏的?
It was painted four years ago. What made it so dirty?

334
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,590
就是个预防性的清洁
This was just a preemptive cleaning,

335
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,500
跟果汁排毒似的
much like a juice cleanse.

336
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,840
但是印第安油画是唯一一副被拿去排毒的?
But the Native American painting is the only one getting the cleanse?

337
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,300
别的油画也将被排毒
Other paintings will also be cleansed.

338
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,140
排毒不太准确
Cleansed is not the right word.

339
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:19,310
抹干净 不 不是抹干净
Wiped. No, not wiped.

340
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,980
清洁
Cleaned.

341
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:25,560
说到今晚的国宴

344
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Sue我需要一扇窗户来...哇哦
Sue, I need a window for the... whoa.

345
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,780
Gary 你白的跟日光灯管一样
Gary, you look whiter than a Georgia country club.

346
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:35,450
-啥? -你特么怎么了?Gary?

347
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,870
我是说现在 我们没时间听你慢慢编故事
I mean currently. We don't have time for the whole tapestry.

348
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,870
我移的画 我干的
I moved the painting. I did it.

我想让她的第一次国宴特别棒
I wanted her first state dinner to be really nice.

352

不 我花了些钱 就是 花了一大笔钱
No, I spent some money.Like, I spent a lot of money.

354
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:54,090
哦 你真的需要告诉她
Oh, you really need to tell her.

355
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,800
Sue 你知道 ...你知道这不容易
Sue, you know... you know it's not as easy as that.

356
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,680
Gary 心中的小屁孩也该长大成熟了
Gary, your inner child needs to grow an outer man.

357
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,600
我只是想让她开心
Okay, I was just trying to make her happy.

358
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,310
任务达成 伙计
Mission incomplete, dude.

359
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,980

-真心感谢 心-连-心 - 棒 棒 哒
- Thank you so much. Heart-to-heart. - Great. Great.

361
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,190
老天 以色列的和平 印第安的战争
Boy, at peace with Israel, at war with Native Americans.

362
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:14,030
你知道我是啥? 我就是梅尔吉布森(反犹)的反义词
Do you know what I am? I'm like the opposite of Mel Gibson.

363
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:16,780
-夫人 沙特人已经不耐烦了 -哦 你应该拖住他们
- Well, ma'am, the Saudis are getting anxious. - Oh, you got to stall them.

364
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,870

不 我没有一会儿能让你耽误
No, I can't give you any little moment.

369
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,250
总统女士  我有GDP数据

370
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,040

Gary 当我真正在吃晚宴的时候
Gary, I am going to think about the dinner

374

我自然我会考虑晚宴的
when I'm actually putting the dinner in my mouth.

375
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,850
现在我们需要的正是一些丑得掉渣的
Now what we need is a lot more butt-ugly

376
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,980
印第安油画 好吧
Native American paintings, okay?

因为第一张丑掉渣被某些
Because the first butt-ugly one was removed

389
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,090
第8章第5节是彼此矛盾的?

呃 我同事Egan先生 更加严谨一些

I'm flying solo. I'm fucking Amelia Earhart

408
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:10,020
-你还欠我一个下属 -下属?
- And you owe me a staff. - Staff?

好啊 我猜你会见到他们的
Oh, well, I guess you'll meet them all

410
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,940
在你瞎编的斯克塞电影里
at the Scorsese screening you're having in your head.

411
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,650
好啊 我猜我就去告诉大家
Oh, well, I guess I'll just start telling people

412
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,230
是你编造了Danny Chung受俘谣言
that you're the one that planted the Danny Chung torture rumors.

413
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,860
-你他妈的闭嘴 -哦 我他妈的闭嘴?

嗨 给我看看你和Kent
Hey, so let me see the photo face

423
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,090
努力打造的上镜脸
that you and Kent were working on.

424
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,770
这个不妙
That's not good.

425
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,850
你在撑鼻孔
You're flaring your nostrils.

426
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,400
-自然就这样了 -这么着吧 你看我

就是这样 宝贝儿 不不 这很好

431
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,660
这样看起来很开心 即使你并不开心
That looked happy, even if you're not happy.

432
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,170
这就是诀窍
That's the trick.

433
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:16,130
你得保证她这儿的高度
You got to make sure she has height here.

434
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:19,300
多点发量 她这儿的头比较塌
A lot of volume because her skull is low.

435
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,170
跟凹进去一块似的
It's kind of indented.

436
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,380
芭芭拉史翠珊不来晚宴了

438
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,560
-来参加晚宴? 没 -我想如果白宫外面有
- For the dinner? No. - I think if there are three whole flower trucks

439
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:30,850
三辆花车的话 我会知道的
parked outside the White House, I would know about it.

440
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,930
快去 外面 数数花车
Go. Outside, go. Count the flower trucks.

- You would not believe the day that I'm having. - Oh, what a day.

445

我感到这将是我回忆录中关键的一幕了
I feel like this is gonna be a key scene in my biopic.

446
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,990
嗨 我要件衬衫 这不是在拍虎胆龙威
Hey, I need a shirt. This isn't "Die Hard."

447
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,660
嗨 甜小奶 你把规则委员会迷得晕头转向了么
Hey, sugar tits, did you stroke and choke the rules committee?

448
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,120
哦 当然了 Egan捅了点篓子
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Egan dropped the ball a little bit,

449
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,830
但是我补救了 他是个好孩子
but I picked it up. He's a good kid.

450
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,750
那边的天才小少年怎么样
How's it going with Mr. Genius Bar over there?

他很上进又勤奋又从不抱怨
He's eager and hardworking and never complains

452
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,250
每天晚上我都做梦淹死他
and every night I dream of drowning him.

453
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:03,970
-你想把他甩掉么? -天啊 好的
- How would you like to get rid of him? - God, yes.

454
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:07,590
Jonah 我真为你自豪 可爱的我都想把你当泡泡浴海绵捏捏捏
Jonah, I am so proud of you, I could squeeze you like a sponge in the shower.

455
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,010
哦 好 我跟你走
Yo, yeah. Yep, I'll come with you.

你有七条未读信息
You have seven missed messages.

457
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,850

Should I read 'em to you? I'll read 'em to you. Oh.

458
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,270
呃 Jonah 你看, Amy告诉我Richard的事
Uh, Jonah, look, Amy was telling me all about Richard here.

459
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:21,190
Richard是助理的助理
Richard apparently is the assistant's assistant.

460
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,860
你是说 他就是一个简易助手
Does that mean, like, he's the epitome of an assistant

461
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,820
-还是他是助理的助手 -第一个
- or he's just an assistant's assistant? - The first one.

-在白宫工作? -对
- Work in the White House? - Yeah.

465
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,870
这是在开玩笑么? 这是在整我么?
Am I being "Punk'd"? Is this hazing?

466
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,290
我兄弟就被整过 他处理得不太好
Happened to my brother once. He did not handle it well.

467
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,380
行了 Jonah 就这样吧
All right, well, Jonah, there you go.

468
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,550

Thank you. I owe you one.

476
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,860
你当然欠我 不然我干嘛干这事
Of course you do. Why else would I have done it?

477
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:04,030
Gary 在干吗? 累死美国么?
What's Gary doing? Trying to max out America?

478
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,650
哇喔 还真有人用阿凡达钛来做灯罩?
Wow, who knew they made lampshades out of unobtanium?

好了 关于我的朋友Gary的坏话我一律没听到
Okay, guys, I will not hear a single bad word about my friend Gary.

480
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,870
但是 他确实有点失控了
But, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he's out of control.

481
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,910
你看到晚宴的开销了么?
Did you see the cost of the dinner?

482
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:16,910
这会让我们难堪 让我们显得糜烂又高高在上
This'll sting us, make us look decadent and remote.

483
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,080
这话是从穿华伦天奴礼服的普林斯顿毕业生嘴里说的
Yeah, said the Princeton grad in the Valentino tux.

484
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,460
总统需要知道么?
Does the president need to know?

485
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,210
她盘子里已经放不下了 不是故意双关的
She's got a lot on her plate right now, no pun intended.

486
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:26,720
她这个中间人花起钱来好像巴比伦王? 还是该告诉她
That her bagman spends like a Babylonian king? Yes, I think so.

487
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,630
你去告诉她 她喜欢你
You can tell her. She likes you.

488
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:30,970
我没打算告诉她 你想说你去说
And I plan on keeping it that way, so I'll leave it to you.

489
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,390
Sue 你可以去告诉总统么

看到没
See that?

497
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,080
在白宫这"翼"我们就这么做事的
It's kind of how we do things here in "the Wing."

498
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,950
穿过这扇门就是总统办公室
Now through this door is the Oval Office.

499
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,960

You are like the coolest guy I've ever met.

501
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,500
总统和我 我俩就像这样
The president and I, we're like this.

502
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,420
-你懂的 抽象了点 -是啊

Thank you.

504
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,900

谢谢 我觉得也是
Thank you. I think so.

506
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,190
天 我希望你没有什么过敏的
God, I hope you don't have any allergies, though,

507
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:32,360
这些花束可真是壮观啊 是不是?
'cause these centerpieces are kind of imposing, aren't they?

508
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,530
最好别有啥照片泄露 我看美国的媒体啊
Better not leak any photos. I see your media

509
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:36,740
最喜欢在你花了多少钱上大惊小怪
likes to make a big fuss about how much you spend.

510
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,540
哦 是啊

513
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,750
是说晚宴么? 谁弄得?Patty?
Is it the state dinner? What, is it Patty?

514
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:49,380
-不是Patty -那是谁

517
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,220
他花了多少钱?
How much has he spent?

518
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:57,850
想象一下猫王有天觉得自己挺有钱的
Well, imagine Elton John on a day he feels fat.

519
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,560
媒体还在抓着那油画的事紧咬不放
Press just kept sniffing around after the stink about the painting.

520
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,650
顺便一提 我们要不要追究谁把画移走了?
Did we ever find out who movedthat painting, by the way?

521
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,520
呃 那估计也是Gary干的
Um, that would be Gary, too.

522
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,190
所以我刚刚和以色列达成
So I have just brokered a peace deal

523
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,820
和平协议
with Israel here.

524
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,240
我 美利坚合众国总统
I, as President of the United States,

525
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:16,780
终于做出点成就
have actually achieved something,

526
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,120
-还没人听说 -对
- which is virtually unheard of. - Yeah.

527
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:21,700
然后我就要跟什么油画分头条
And yet I'm sharing headline news with a painting

528
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:25,500
就因为那边的那个家伙?
because of that guy right there?

529
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,880

535
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,940
白宫欢迎你们
welcome to the White House.

536
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,360
仇恨是种强大的情感
Hatred is a powerful emotion.

537
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,660
但不是最强大的
But not the most powerful.

538
00:22:55,950 --> 00:23:00,450
希望比仇恨要强大得多
Hope is more powerful than hate.

539
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,620
希望能够成就大业
Hope can build.

540
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:08,330
但为了燃起希望 首先我们需要信任
But for hope to grow, we first need trust,

541
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,880
不是么
don't we?

542
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,550
借用一位前总统的话来说
To paraphrase a predecessor of mine,

543
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,890
我们无可信任 除了信任本身
we have nothing to trust but trust itself.

544
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,190
Gary?
Gary?

545
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,520

546
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,030
-从那出来 -夫人 如果你听我解释

Come out here now.

548
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:50,080
你以为你是谁啊  Gary Antoinette?
Who do you think you are, Gary Antoinette?

549
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,540
你是第一夫人吗?
Did somebody make you first lady?

550
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,960
我可不记得我去了你啊 Gary
'Cause I don't remember marrying you, Gary.

551
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,300
我不记得我在尼亚加拉大瀑布操过你
I don't remember fucking you in Niagara Falls.

552
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,890
要是有我肯定能记住
I think I'd remember that.

553
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,510
夫人 油画的事我很抱歉
Ma'am, I'm really sorry for the painting

554
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:01,850
花钱的事我也很抱歉

555
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:04,180
-但是你必须要理解...-哦你给我闭嘴

556
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:06,020
给我闭嘴
Just shut up.

557
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:09,560
你不重要 好吗?
You are unimportant, okay?

558
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,770
你紧紧巴住我不放
And you have suckered onto me

559
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,030
跟车窗上的吸盘加菲猫玩具似的
like some sort of a car window Garfield.

560
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,610
夫人 这不是事实
That is not true, ma'am.

561
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,360
你以为你是这儿的大杀器么?
You think you're some sort of a big shot here?

562
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,450
哦 我的天啊 你不是什么大杀器 Gary
Oh, my God, you are not a big shot, Gary.

563
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:26,620
你就是一个给我的眉毛夹消毒的中年男人
You're a middle-aged man who sanitizes my tweezers.

564
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:29,960
-天啊 -你错了
- God. - You're wrong.

565
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:32,630
-你说啥? -Catherine生日是哪天?

566
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,170
-6月8 -9号
- June eighth. - Ninth.

567
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:36,510
-9号 -哪位参议员的女儿在戒毒?

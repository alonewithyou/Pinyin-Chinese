00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,580
比如那个想要圣诞老人在圣诞节

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:31,110
教他读书识字的西雅图小男孩
to teach him how to read for Christmas.

5
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:32,650
那他是怎么写的心愿?
How did he write the note?

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,020
或者阿拉巴马州松树山的那个小女孩
Or the little girl down in Pine Hill, Alabama.

7
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,250
她通过母乳感染了HIV

8
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,930
但仍然梦想成为芭蕾舞者
but who still dreams of becoming a ballerina.

9
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,630
跳芭蕾确实得瘦

00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:47,200
- 他们为什么不能呢? - 怎么? 真的要瘦呀

We want to give all kids a reason to dance, you know?

12
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,500
耶稣受难日(复活节前的星期五)

13
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,640
- 先生? - 嗯？

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,110
- 那个艾滋女孩 - 怎么?
- The HIV girl. - Yes?

15
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,930
总统在CBS采访中提到的那个
The one that the president mentioned in the CBS interview.

16
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:01,670
- 怎么了? - 是这样 那个天涯论坛上的一些人
- Yes? - All right, well, some people on Reddit

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,950
把细节拼凑起来人肉了她 现在整个镇子都知道她是谁了
put the details together, now the whole town knows who she is.

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,250
卧槽!
Fuck!

19
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,470
我更喜欢只有远景(古老的搜索引擎)
I preferred the Internet when it was just AltaVista

20
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:09,150
和玩星球大战的小屁孩的互联网
and that little Star Wars kid.

21
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,050
- 我们确实把这女孩曝露了? - 是的

22
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,320
- 妈的 - 本来只有她的医生和校长知道

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,990
现在家长们不让孩子们去学校
Now parents are keeping their kids home from school

24
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,000
因为他们不想 原话是"传染上艾滋病"
'cause they don't want them to, quote, "Catch AIDS."

25
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,790
看来这个镇子还没受过撑同志大游行的洗礼
Well, there's a town with no Gay Pride parade

26
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,630
连他妈的图书馆都没有

00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:21,740
这个信息从哪儿来?
Where did this data come from?

28

我们怎么搞到她的医疗记录的?
How did we get her medical records?

29
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:24,730
还有为什么我们没有事先征得她父母同意?
And why didn't we ask her parents' permission?

30
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,040
谢谢你 十万个为什么先生

45
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,030
或是我还能控制住问题的时候

46
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,400
是啊
Right.

47

每周都是这样
This has been happening every week.

53
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,550
我的私人生活不应该被侵犯
My private life should be off-limits.

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,180
我看到你还在和Jason约会?

77
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,200
白宫泄露了
The White House

With respect, ma'am, do you think those same privacies

101
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:05,090
也应该被给予同样的隐私权吗？
should be given to an eight-year-old girl with HIV?

102
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,530
呃 嗯...
Um, well...

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,570
艾滋病确实是可怕的负担
HIV is a terrible burden

104
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,200
不过我很开心能帮助被其感染的家庭
and I'm very happy to be helping families who are affected by it.

105
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,860
这个不能写入报道
That is off the record.

106
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,940

艾滋病打哪来的？
Where did HIV come from?

111
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,620
我觉得是有人上了只猴搞出来的
I think some guy fucked a monkey.

112
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,890
老天爷啊！
Jesus Christ!

113
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,900
麦克 你为啥没提醒我？
Why didn't you warn me about that, Mike?

114
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,130
夫人 你刚进来我就试着提醒过你
Ma'am, I tried to right when you came in.

115
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,690
-不 你没有 -你说得对 我没有
- No, you didn't. - You're right, I didn't.

116
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,230
-我本该提醒你的 -说得对
- I should have. - That's right.

117

-您是对的 夫人 -嗯 对 你完全没提醒我
- You were right, ma'am. - Yeah, no, you didn't warn me at all.

118
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,910
又他妈的咋的了？
What the fuck is happening?

119
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,110
是一起数据泄漏
It's a data breach.

120
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,570
医保 社保记录被某个
Medical, Social Security records were hacked

121
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,050
为我们工作的人黑了
by someone working for us

122
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:56,250
并且把数据用进了家庭第一提案发布会材料里
and then put into the Families First press pack.

123
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,510
那可不只是数据泄漏 那是数据崩漏
That's not just a breach. That's a data rupture.

124
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,020
你们说的这些狗屁对老娘来说没有意义
All of these words are meaningless to me.

125
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,010
我们现在要这样做 有个简单粗暴的主意
Here's what we're gonna do. It's an outrageous idea.

126
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,560
找到对这一切负责的人 然后炒了他
Let's find the person who's responsible and let's fire them.

127
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,300
夫人 这个项目有很大的数据流动性
Ma'am, there's so much data fluidity on this project,

128
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,730
罪犯很难被确定
the culprit will be hard to pin down.

129
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,390
好吧 媒体不需要这个罪魁祸首
Well, the press doesn't need the culprit.

130
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,800
他们只需要一个替罪羊
The press needs a culprit.

131
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,200
你知道 有一大群小姑娘
You know, there are hordes of young women

132
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,630
挤满了白宫西厢的大厅
who roam the halls of the West Wing.

133
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,770
- 然后呢？- 其中15%的人被聘用的目的就是被炒
- Yes? - 15% of them were hired to be fired.

134
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,890
对 我们叫他们女敢死队员
Yeah. We call them the Expendabelles.

135
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,120
- 孩子们 一点都不好笑
- That's not funny, boys.

136
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,740
- 不好笑 - 好了 Dan 去献祭一个处女吧
- No. - Okay, Dan, go sacrifice a virgin.

137
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,470
你平常周六的活要周五干了
Just another Saturday night.

138
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,540
- 这不好笑 Amy - 什么？怎么不好笑？
- That's not funny, Amy. - What? Why not?

139
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,650
喂 Egan 是不是有人要因为这艾滋事件要被炒鱿鱼？
Hey, Egan, is somebody gonna get fired over this AIDSnami?

140
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,540
哦 是耶 而且我负责开炮哦
Oh, yeah. And I'm in charge

141
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,620
生杀大权在我手 叫声Dan哥放你走
Hey, of the canning, Jonah. l'm the Dan who can.

142
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,910
好吧 那个 我只是
Okay, well, I was only

143
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,700
通过你参与了家庭第一提案 所以...

好吧 不是嘛?
All right, no?

447
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,460
从你的表情来看 我觉得你还不知情
I'm picking up from your facial cues that you don't know.

448
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:24,140
我给你四个字的面部表情… "煞笔快说"

来得到死亡儿童的数据
from the same data breach that identified the HIV girl.

454

好了 你们俩笨熊听好了
Okay, Yogi and Boo-Boo,

455
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:39,120

- 好的 - 但是 明显你们没懂

You cannot be associated with bullying

461
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,310
否则人们会认为你是受我欺凌的
because people are going to think that you were bullied by me.

462
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,380
我不是受你欺凌 我是因为你而受欺凌
I wasn't bullied by you, I was bullied because of you.

463
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,380

Are you bullying me into dropping an anti-bullying charity?

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,110
- 等等等等 同志们 - 我们一会再解释

不 我们绝对不会解释的
No, we won't. We'll never explain.

480
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,920

那么 你们为什么不告诉我事情经过

女士 它的目标群体是最近失去了子女的夫妇
Ma'am, it targeted recently bereaved parents

496

497
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:26,010
这样...
Well...

498
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,460

"恐怕这已经扩散到肝部没救了"的玩完了?
"I'm afraid it's spread to the liver" Fucked?

和朋友一起干的 但他现在已经不在那儿了
volunteer with a pal at HHS, but he's gone now.

508
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:56,920
如果我们打起精神 以守为攻拼死一搏
If we can just hold our nerve and maintain a bunker mentality...

509
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,410
别和我提那操蛋的以守为攻
Don't give me that bunker shit.

510
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,450
希特勒进了地下室防守
Hitler went into a bunker.

511
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:02,520
出来之后就不是元首了 不是吗?
When he came out, he wasn't chancellor anymore, was he?

512
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,650
而且他还挂了
Plus he was dead.

513
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,270
我告诉你 就算希特勒现在还活着
I'll tell you something, if he were alive right now,

514
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,580
他现在也巴不得想离我远点
he'd be very anxious to distance himself from me at this moment.

515
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,430
这个秘密只能留在这间四...
We need to keep this within these four...

516
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,420
这个椭圆办公室里
Or this one curved wall.

517
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,550
我们要阻止媒体
We need to stop the press

518
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,560
不能让他们再继续挖料了
dead so they don't dig into this any further.

519
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,690
这就意味着要职人员请辞谢罪
And that means a major resignation.

520
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:23,730
得有个人 如果你们要后进先出的话 那我就得滚蛋了
A face. Although, if you operate last in, first out, I'm screwed.

这种迎头痛击 我是你最大的安全气囊
This is a head-on collision and I'm your biggest air bag.

528
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,540
好 所以我们需要发表一篇
Okay, so we need to issue

529
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,130
关于那个艾滋病女孩的积极(阳性)声明
a positive statement about the HIV girl.

530
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,170
不是阳性 措辞不当
Not positive. Wrong word.

531
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,100
Mike 刚刚谈到我可能被炒鱿鱼时
Mike, did I see you smiling

532
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,670
你是在偷笑吗?
when it was suggested I might be fired?

533
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,750
我? 没有啊 我才没笑呢
Me? No. I... I wasn't smiling.

534
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,710
我只是抿嘴而已 因为嘴唇有点儿干
I was stretching my lips because I have very dry lips,

535
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,540
我的医生叫我多抿嘴唇
and my doctor said, "You should probably stretch them."

536
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,390
所以我只是听从医生建议而已 像...
So I was following medical advice. Like...

537
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:05,130
-像这样 -这就是那你的解释?
- Like that. - That's what you're going with?

538
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:08,760
哇 听着 如果你玩扑克的话 一定叫上我
Wow. Listen, you ever play poker, I want in,

因为你根本就不会撒谎
'cause you are one terrible liar.

540
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,650
你太可悲了 因为撒谎就是你的工作
And that's sad 'cause that's your whole job.

541
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:21,700
你为啥用我旁边的便池？
Why are you using the urinal next to me?

542
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,080
-你应该留个间隔 -我已经开始尿啦
- You leave a gap. - I've already started.

543

用那个小的会有尿溅到我
The little one gives me splash-back.

544
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,270
但是你也得留个空位 毕竟我们不是尿友
Still, you leave a gap. We're not piss buddies.

545
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,440
该死 你还可以控制你的前列腺嘛
Damn, that's some kind of prostate control.

You don't tell anyone until she's made an announcement.

551
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:48,890
-明白 -一个字也不会泄漏

就因为你是个记者和白痴

- 你的苏打水 - 谢谢

142
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,870
我把香槟倒在瓶子里了
I put the champagne in the water bottles.

143
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,960
- 你不用解释 我能看出来 - 是啊
- You don't have to explain. I can tell what you did. - Yeah.

144
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,540
噢 你们看看Doyle
Oh, look at doyle.

145
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,430
他是戴过牙套了吗? 哦 额滴神啊
Did he have his teeth capped? Oh, my god.

146
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,100
最后一个幸存的金发女郎
The last surviving golden girl.

147
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,190
差点就把他送进禁区
Almost put him in the penalty box for that,

148
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,250
不过那是曲棍球 所以...
But that's hockey, so...

149
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,590
我要说几句
I'm gonna say a little something.

150
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,970
这最开始不是写给总统用的吗?
Wasn't this originally written for potus?

151
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,480
演讲就是演讲
A speech is a speech.

152
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,430
音位变换组合以产生意义
Phonemes connecting to produce meanings.

153
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,730
运动能把我们聚在一起
Sports can bring us together,

154
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,870
结束对同性恋的憎恶
Help end homophobia.

155
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:15,070
当我还是个...小男孩的时候
When I was a... Boy,

156
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:17,620
是我的男同朋友们
It was my gay friends

157
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,540
教会了我如何容忍他人
Who taught me how to be tolerant

158
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:24,630
如何直面你自己
And how to be true to yourself

159
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,330
还有如何跟麦当娜跳舞
And how to dance to madonna.

160
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,470
- 麦当娜? - 什么鬼?
- Madonna? - What?

161
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,550
我是要说这个来着吗?
was I supposed to say that?

162
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,470
你造 在大学时 我的...
You know, back in college, my...

163
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,480
女朋友会--男朋友--我的朋友...
Girlfriends would-- boyfriends-- my friends...

164
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,850
或许是该重新写写来着
Perhaps it did need some reworking.

165
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,080
德黑兰 纳沙德机场酒店

166
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,630
谢谢你的帮忙 Abbas
Thank you so much for your assistance, abbas.

167
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,600
他们把那记者带出去了
They're bringing the journalist out.

168
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,070
- 他是你朋友吗? - Leon吗? 噢 天哪 才不是
- Is he a friend of yours? - Leon? Oh, god, no.

169
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,310
他是傻逼中的战斗逼
He is the asshole of an asshole's asshole.

170
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,160
我对那些要带他走的兄弟们表示抱歉
I feel bad for the guys who had to guard him.

171
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,360
- Mike - Leon
- Mike. - Leon.

172
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,830
你这张我永远不想亲的脸
A face I never thought I'd want to kiss.

173
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,080
- 现在依然不想 - 宾馆不错吧?
- I still don't. - Nice hotel?

174
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,030
还不错 我会在"旅行家"上写点儿什么夸夸它
Yeah, I'll have something to say about it on tripadvisor.

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,170
- 有史以来最差劲的酒柜 - 以及其他东西 是的
- Worst minibar ever. - Amongst other things, yeah.

176
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,540
噢 这是Abbas 我们的联络人
Oh, this is abbas, our liaison.

177
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,670
- 这是Leon West - 很抱歉 West先生
Leon west. Apologies, mr. West.

178
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,130
两国都延期了这次会晤
Both countries had to deny the visit,

179
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,790
不过现在我们确定了
But now we confirm.

180
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,050
等等 两国?
Wait, both countries?

181
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,600
啊 他英语不是很好
Uh, his english isn't very good.

182
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,930
我还是能听得懂的
It sounded fine to me.

183
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,520
至于你 先生 准备好坐空军一号飞回家吧
And you, sir, get to fly home on air force one.

184
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,270
- 哇哦 - 是的
- Whoa. - Yeah.

185
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,190
我要是因为这个激动是不是太肤浅了
I'm shallow enough for that to be exciting.

186
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,970
你知道它连核爆炸都不怕吗?
Did you know it can survive a nuclear blast?

187
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,270
- 是啊 - 知道
- Yeah. - Yeah.

188
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,060
除非你的手下准备这么炸一下
Not that you guys are planning one.

189
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:29,700
我--无视我吧 我也不知道为啥我要说这个
I-- ignore me. I don't know why I said that.

190
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:32,280
他的英语也不是很好啊
His english isn't very good.

191
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,400
那么 我们走吧
well, let's get you going.

192
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,070
总统准备了一大杯加冰苏格兰威士忌给你
The president has a big-ass scotch on the rocks for you.

193
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,020
- 不错 - 其实就是加了冰的茶 冰茶
- Yeah. - Which is iced tea. It's iced tea.

194
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,460
- 谢谢你 Abbas - Mike
- Thank you, abbas. - Mike.

195
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,630
谢谢你
Thank you.

196
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,000
- 旅途安全 - 你留在这也要安全
- Safe trip. - Safe stay.

197
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,700
那么 让我们来庆祝一下我和我的团队所取得的成就
So let's celebrate all things l and gbt.

198
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,420
好吗?
Huh?

199
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,740
在LGBT基础上加上了queer(对自身性别不认同的人)

200
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,390
不过现在我们用了更具包容性的LGBTQ
Though these days we use the more inclusive lgbtq.

201
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,680
确实!
We do!

202
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,650
呃 我...
Um, and I...

203
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,520
尊重所有人做q的权利(其实他是不懂在胡扯)
Respect all people's rights to be a q.

204
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
或者不只是q
Or rather just q.

205
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,560
是啊 只是q
Yeah, just q.

206
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,830
他听起来像是在学习性别表一样
Sounds like he's learning a sex alphabet.

207
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,360
我曾见过北美灰熊嘴里的大马哈鱼
I've seen a salmon in a grizzly's mouth

208
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,030
都没有他这个恐怖啊
Look less panicky than that.

209
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:27,570
大家都知道q意味着有问题的
Everybody knows that q means questioning.

210
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:33,710
讽刺的是 直男们
Ironically, the straight guy

211
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,910
对同性恋们的认识十分僵化
Is very stiff around the gay guy.

212
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,430
我们的投票显示他更被广泛地认为成
Our polling said that he was widely perceived

213
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,420
老古板
As quite wooden.

214
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,470
你为什么要投票给他?
Why were you polling him?

215
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,850
我投给他是为了反对那些潜在的竞选对手
I was polling him against other potential running mates.

216
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:48,640
- 向后退! - 我可不是个倒着走的人 Amy
- Just move! - I'm not a backwards walker, amy.

217
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,690
总统向Doyle保证他会出现在选票上
The president promised doyle he'd be on the ticket

218
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,530
她不会投其他可能的竞选对手的票
And she wouldn't poll other possible running mates.

219
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:57,200
没人跟我说过这些
No one told me that.

220
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,240
又一次 左手完全不知道右手在干嘛
Yet again, the left hand has no idea what the right hand is doing

221
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,500
而畸形的第三只手
And the freakish middle

222
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,790
一下下打在我胸口上
hand is punching me repeatedly in the tits.

223
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,270
好吧 那是个教训
Well, that was an education.

224
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,210
我是说 我真正想做的是去政治游说
I mean, what I really want to do is get into lobbying.

225
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,480
不过已经过去了 大概
But it's only been, like,

226
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,910
四十五天 所以我再也不对它抱有幻想了
six weeks and three days, so I'm not sweating it.

227
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,130
哦 别挂 我有个电话进来
Oh, hold on. I got another call.

228
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:18,120
Sidney 嗨! 太好玩了
Sidney, hey! It's so funny.

229
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,010
我刚刚还在跟一个朋友说政治游说--
I was literally just commenting to a friend about lobb--

230
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,680
是 没错 一点也不好玩
Yeah, you're right, that's not interesting.

231
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,680
是的 我很想加入
Yes, I would love to come in.

232
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,010
所以这就是PKM
So this is pkm.

233
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:30,790
PKM - Sidney Purcell的办公室

234
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,850
这地方也太大了
This place is huge.

235
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,600
是啊 等你看到海豚馆再说
Yep. Wait till you see the dolphinarium.

236
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,930
就在拉丁部旁边
It's right near the latin quarter.

237
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,600
他还有一块了红灯区
And he's got the red-light district.

238
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,520
天哪 这地方太奇妙了
God, this place is so awesome.

239
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,910
我有点儿看上它了
I kind of feel like hitting on it.

240
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
好吧 这儿的女人你可以随便看 如果你想的话
Well, there's women here you can do that to if you wanted.

241
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,830
我注意到了 哦 那么 丹 这是我的筹码
I noticed. Oh. So, dan, here's my pitch.

242
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,160
我能让你变得富有
I can make you so rich,

243
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,820
富得能让比尔盖茨在你大腿上跳舞
you can pay bill gates to give you a lap dance.

244
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,250
让我听听你的筹码吧
Let me hear your pitch.

245
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,620
好吧 我很聪明 人脉很广--
Well, I'm smart, well-connected--

246
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,540
而且是被炒了的 对 别忘了你是被解雇的
And fired. Yeah, don't forget fired.

247
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,090
-之所以被炒 -哦 好吧
- Fired up... - Oh, okay.

248
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,660
是为了让我的各种关系为你的客户服务
To put my contacts to work for your clients.

249
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,760
哦 这对我的钱包来讲就是妙音啊
Well, that's music to my wallet.

250
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
不过你准备好了在Mike Mclintock的门阶上拉屎吗？
But are you ready to take a dump on Mike McLintock's doorstep?

251
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,270
这是入帮仪式之类的吗？
Like an initiation kind of thing?

252
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,000
不是 我说的是 你能接受你的客户们
No, I mean, can you take on clients

253
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,350
都将会因为你捣乱Meyer总统的计划而受益吗？
who are best served by you shitting on the Meyer agenda?

254
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,860
哦 让我想想
Oh, well, let me think about that.

255
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:13,140
-好啊 当然了 -很好
- Yeah. Yeah. - Great.

256
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,640
我们过段时间再来谈这个门阶拉屎的事
We'll get to that doorstep thing later, though.

257
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,140
好啊 我还是想那么做的 我喜欢干这事
Yeah, I'll still do that. I'm into it.

女士 请允许我向您介绍这一小时的英雄
Ma'am, may I present the hero of the hour

259
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,150
和您一样是英雄
along with yourself.

Well, I'm sure food is the last thing on your mind.

269
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,090
我知道这是我想的最后一样东西
I know it's the last thing on my mind.

- I wonder if you're hungry, though. - Yes, I am.

271
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,560
因为我要告诉你 这次中东之旅
Because I'll tell you something, the adrenaline

272
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,100
身上产生的肾上腺素使我不需要吃任何东西
on this Mideast trip has just kept me from eating anything.

273
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,550
你刚刚是不是说你确实想吃点东西
Did you just say you do want something to eat?

274

276
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,650

你想吃点什么？
What would you like to eat?

280
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,560
除了鹰嘴豆 都可以
Anything that's not chickpeas.

281
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:14,200
嘿 为什么这两条可爱的长腿要从我身边走开？
Hey! Why are those lovely long legs walking away from me?

282
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,700
说的应该是你吧
Probably means you.

283
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
是的 没关系 我来搞定

284
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,460
我不是推卸责任 但是这次彩虹色的
I am not in the blame game, but that rainbow-colored

285
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:22,680
大灾难完全就是你的错
clusterfuck in there was entirely your fault.

搞什么？ 你刚才是想
What the fuck? Did you just

288
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,420
把Kent拉下水来救你自己吗？
throw Kent into the blender to save your own ass?

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,510
也不是完全拉下水
Not fully into the blender.

290
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:32,390
也许只是拉了一点点 就只是脚趾 因为……
Maybe just a little bit. Just the toe, 'cause...

291
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,420
这才是你到这儿后
That is the Jonah I've been

292
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,060
我一直试图唤醒的Jonah嘛

293
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,730
Kent Davison是个不忠诚的混球
And Kent Davison is a disloyal fucking prick.

294
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,150

我特想把他脸上那副中立的表情抹掉
I want to wipe that neutral expression off his face.

我们这样做 好吧？

我们泄漏出副总统现在很不满意
We're gonna leak that the VP is dissatisfied

298
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,290
他想退出的消息
and that he's thinking of walking.

299
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,160
我们要逼总统来支持Doyle
We're gonna force POTUS to back Doyle.

300
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,710
我不会让你失望的
I will not let you down.

301
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,290
好的 那么你在媒体里有哪些熟人？

-在这下面放两个桶 -噢!

这真是一段不可思议的时光
It's just been such a magical time.

310
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,230
我真希望我能够访问世界上每个国家

你知道吗？ 连新西兰我都想去

听说人们现在都把我和尼克松比较 对吗？
People are now comparing me to Nixon, I heard, right?

313
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,600
-他们不是说的你的样貌 -不 不 不 我也不是说外貌
- They didn't mean your looks. - No, no, no, I don't mean that.

314
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,490
但是 我接受这种比较
But, I mean, I'll take the comparison.

315
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,990
那么 我们从哪儿谈起呢？
So where would you like to begin?

316
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,990
嗯 我也不太清楚最近都发生了什么
Well, I don't really know what's happened lately

317
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,360
因为我被锁在
because I've been locked in a

318
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,530
酒店房间 与外界隔绝里
hotel room without access to the outside world.

319
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,830
当然 你知道我们需要做什么吗？
Of course. You know what we need to do?

320
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,250
我们需要给Leon拿些剪报

321
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,750
我想他会想看看的

325
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,420
以至于我把到这儿的时间推迟了一天

发表了一篇报道说Doyle有不满

340
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,530
我要不要去看看
Should I go and see if there's

341
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,320
媒体专机上有没有关于这事的闲言？
any chatter about this on the press plane?

342
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,380
老天 还是数据泄漏的原因
Christ, it's that data fuck.

343
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,050
不是 我也不知道 是
No. I don't know. Yes.

344
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,360
就当作我不知道吧
Let's just go with I don't know.

345
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,880
行了 都别往那边看 Leon在看着呢

好吧 那么你进去 分散他的注意力

- I was in a hotel, so it wasn't that bad. - Oh, no.

352
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,400
Leon开始认为他被推迟一天释放
Leon is starting to think that his release was delayed by a day

353
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,400
是因为我到这儿推迟了一天
because my arrival here was delayed by a day.

354
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,940
他会想明白 是我们直到现在才同意他被释放
He's gonna figure out that we didn't okay his release till now

355
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:45,520
然后就这件事他会写些不好的报道
and then he'll write something bad about that.

356
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,720
-那就糟了 -是的

-现在情况也很糟糕 -是很糟糕了

你需要休息一下吗?
Would you like to put a pin in this for a moment?

368

扣留了一个美国记者
Detaining an american journalist

370

-Leon 你需要休息 -嗯

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,430
美国政府在计划一次秘密访问
I say the us is planning a secret trip.

426
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,350
伊方要求你们承认这次秘密访问
The iranians ask you to confirm the secret trip.

427
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,150
你否认了秘密访问 因为这是个机密
You say there's no secret trip because it's a secret.

428
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,440
他们以为我是007 于是就扣押了我
They think I'm james bond and detain me.

429
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:38,690
Leon 你他喵的才不是007
Leon, you're no fucking james bond.

430
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,610
记者都爱编故事
Journalism is storytelling.

431
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:44,500
你说的是关于的你的勇气 正直
You tell your story about your bravery, your integrity

432
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,920
以及我们如何营救你 给你温暖的故事
And how we rescued you and gave you warm nuts.

433
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:49,090
伊方是因为你才扣押我的
The iranians detained me because of you.

434
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,710
这就是我的故事
That's my story.

435
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,710
就因为你我被多扣留了一天
They detained me an extra day because of you.

436
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,080
这是我另一个故事
That's my other story.

437
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,100
你这个不知好歹的杂种 还想被救吗?
Now, you want to be rescued or not, you ungrateful shit?

438
00:16:57,130 --> 00:16:59,080
因为总统想凭释放一个美国人上头条
My release was delayed because the president

439
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,580
我就被延迟释放了
Wanted to grab the headlines for freeing an american,

440
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,190
所以她不是故意不释放这个美国人
An american she deliberately did not de-detain.

441
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,310
Jonah 要么把Leon的妈妈喊来空军基地
Jonah, either get leon's mom to the air base

442
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
要么就给你自己买个像样点的假发
Or buy yourself a very convincing wig.

443
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:12,360
-Kent呢? -我母鸡啊
- Where's kent? - I don't know.

444
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,950
可能他关掉了自己的追踪器
Maybe he's bitten off his tracking device.

445
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,860
他现在应该到了才对 这不对劲啊
He should be here by now. This is not okay.

446
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,150
-Mike -Sue 把黄丝带弄断

Gary 拿出点男子汉气概 别那么娘
Man up, gary. Or at least lady down a bit.

449
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,910
Gary和Mike被落在伊朗了
Gary and mike have been left behind in iran.

450
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,130

Wonderful. It's "Black hawk down" With laurel and hardy.

451
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,630
Amy 如果被问起 别说有人落在伊朗
Amy, if anyone asks, no one's been left behind in iran.

452
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,830
你来了 你刚去哪了?
There you are. Where have you been?

453
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,450
我等你等到胡子都长出来了
I grew a small beard here.

454
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,950
Bill 我已经从慢慢走到快步走了
Bill, of my various walking paces, I selected moderate to fast.

455
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,290
媒体都说副总统对总统不满
The press are saying that the vp is unhappy with the president.

456
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,680
-这可不妙 -是因为地下民意调查吗?
- That doesn't make me happy. - Because of the secret polling?

457
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,810
还是因为他听说
Or because he's heard that

458
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,680
有人黑了去世孩童的资料?
someone has hacked the data of dead children?

459
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:49,300
或者还有更糟糕的原因?
Or a third reason which is even worse than those?

460
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,230
我们只好钻进Doyle脑袋里 看看他知道什么
We've got to get inside doyle's head, find out what he knows.

461
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:53,600
-出去 -不 请进 你俩出去
- Get out. - No, come in. You get out.

462
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:56,190
Mike 你为啥打给我?

463
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,160
-Sue 我们该怎么办? -那里有一架备用飞机

529
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,560
Mike 你说为啥不给备用飞机再准备个备用飞机?
Why isn't there a backup plane for the backup plane, mike?

530
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,230
我们得去坐媒体专用飞机
We need to get on the press plane.

531

媒体们恨咱们 尤其你
The press hates us, especially you.

532
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:35,980
他们受不了你 Gary 我们有酒
They can't stand you. We have booze, gary.

533
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,470
他们对酒没有抵抗力

啥 这能行吗?在一个干燥的国家

有酒的人说了算

嘿 同志们 啥事?
Hey, guys, what's up?

540
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:54,420
夫人 我们担心Doyle可能知道投票的事了
Ma'am, we're worried that doyle knows about the polling.

541
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,670
什么投票?Kent
What polling? Kent.

542
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,870
我认为有必要观察一下
I thought it might be

543
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:00,420
Doyle作为副总统是怎么表现的
useful to see how doyle is performing as veep.

544
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,660
我特意向Doyle保证不会那么做 Kent
I specifically promised doyle that I would not do that, kent.

545
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,880
抱歉 但这确实带来了有趣的结果
I apologize. But it did throw up some very interesting results.

546
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,600
但我还是等你没那么生气的时候再告诉你
But I will run those by you at a less angry time.

547
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,970
我们想了一个自认为很机智的计划
We have what we think is a very smart plan of action.

548
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,550
挺牛逼的 相当牛逼
It's brilliant. Quite brilliant.

549
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:17,310
我们告诉Doyle你的竞选活动
We tell doyle that your campaign

550
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,520
利用丢失的数据筛选出丧子的父母作为目标

551
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,640

00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,730
这么做?我的神呐！
Would you do that? My god!

553
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,620
还有说这事的时候你能不能用暗号?
And can you please use code when we're talking about this?

554
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:31,450
用个什么词 比如说 用 纸杯蛋糕 代替 数据
Use the word, I don't know, cupcake instead of data

555
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,040
用 幸福 代替 丧子 之类的
And use happy instead of bereaved or something.

556
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,330
这样做能把他拉来我们这边 影响他
It binds him to us. Infects him.

557
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,600
而且他办公室那边
And elements of his office

558
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,660
被抄送了提到违规的邮件
were cc'd on e-mails mentioning the breach.

559
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,330
没错 这起盗用去世孩子的蛋糕事件后
Exactly, he will be as involved as the rest of us

560
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:46,670
他会和我们其他人一样
In targeting happy parents after stealing cupcakes

561
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,170
被卷入幸福父母的筛选事件
About their dead children.

562
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,720
好吧
fine.

563
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,590
向他注入幸福小蛋糕病毒 好吧?
Inject him with the happy cupcake virus, all right?

564
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,430
希望他变肿大然后挂掉
I hope he swells up and dies.

565
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,480
顺便说一句 这不是暗语
That's not code, by the way.

566

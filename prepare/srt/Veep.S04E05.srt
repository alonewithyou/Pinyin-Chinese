1
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:22,690
总有人问我 "谁是roger furlong?"
{\fs14}People are always asking me, "Who is roger furlong?"

2
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:25,880
我经常推荐他们去看一本好书里的某一段落
{\fs14}And I always refer them to the same passage of the good book.

3
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,710
圣经
{\fs14}The scriptures.

4
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,330
"饮水即知挖井人"
{\fs14}"Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."

5
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:32,830
好 我们开始
{\fs14}All right, let's do it.

6
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,200
作为第一女儿 我身上责任重大
{\fs14}Being the first daughter is a big responsibility.

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:38,260
很好 但我很乐意为国家效力
{\fs14}Good. But I'm happy to serve my country

8
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:41,680
并帮助我妈妈 很不错 嗯
{\fs14}And to help out my mom. That's very good, yes.

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:44,260
我爱你 妈妈 哦 不 亲爱的
{\fs14}I love you, mom. Oh, no, honey.

10
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,480
你需要表现的很诚恳 亲爱的
{\fs14}You've got to say it like you mean it, though, darling.

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,770
多简单 就像"我爱你 妈妈
{\fs14}It's so easy. It's like, "I love you, mom.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,720
我爱你"呃 不是那样
{\fs14}I love you." Well, not like that.

13
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,880
我的国家和我的生活
{\fs14}There are great changes

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,070
都会发生了很大的变化
{\fs14}coming for this nation and my own life, too.

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,560
去年我遇到一个叫Jason的男孩
{\fs14}Last year I met a boy called jason.

16
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:59,190
我不清楚 她该说男孩还是男人?
{\fs14}Mm, I don't know, should she say boy or man?

17
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,250
-如果要更清楚的话? -对 这问题提得好 夫人
{\fs14}Just to be clear? Yes, that's a good question, ma'am.

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,230
我当然是男人 不是吗?
{\fs14}It's clear that I'm a man, isn't it?

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,620
我都好几年买酒不查驾照了了 大概三年了吧
{\fs14}I haven't been carded for years. Like, three years.

20
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:08,070
我只是 不知道效果会不会很好
{\fs14}I just-- I don't know if this is gonna play well.

21
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:10,260
你知道不? 我也有这种感觉
{\fs14}You know what? I started to feel that way myself.

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:12,370
这是个大会 大家都喜欢这种狗屁
{\fs14}It's a convention. People love this shit.

23
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:14,510
怎么会不好? 我们在恋爱
{\fs14}How could it not play well? We're in love.

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,380
-是 应该会很好 -可以的
{\fs14}Yeah, it might play well. It could.

25
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,300
-很有可能的 -嗯嗯
{\fs14}I think it might. Mm-hmm.

26
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,430
我受不了Karen了
{\fs14}I cannot take karen anymore.

27
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,890
都好几周了 她连一个陈述句都没说过
{\fs14}It's been weeks and she has yet to speak a declarative sentence.

28
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,470
律师都喜欢掩盖他们的立场
{\fs14}Lawyers tend to cover their bases.

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,440
我那次车祸时深有体会
{\fs14}I know that from my car accident.

30
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,770
当时和一个律师撞了
{\fs14}With a lawyer.

31
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,940
我就直接把她消音
{\fs14}I just tune her out.

32
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,860
知道不 像住在高速公路旁一样
{\fs14}You know, like living next to a highway.

33
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,650
去年我认识了个小伙子叫Jason 之后我们相爱了
{\fs14}Last year I met a guy called jason and we fell in love.

34
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,500
好吧 宝贝
{\fs14}All right, sweetheart,

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,070
听起来你不像是恋爱中的人儿
{\fs14}it doesn't sound like you're in love to me.

36
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,950
更像是被塔利班绑架了
{\fs14}It sounds like you've been kidnapped by the taliban.

37
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,040
没错 我们即将结婚
{\fs14}Exactly. And we're going to get married.

38
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:46,710
所以我想把Jason介绍给你们
{\fs14}So I'd like to introduce you to jason.

39
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,290
出来吧 亲爱的
{\fs14}Come on out, honey.

40
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,630
你听起来像生气了 我就是生气了!
{\fs14}It sounds like you're angry. I am angry!

41
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,210
好吧 这就是你为啥听起来像生气了
{\fs14}Well, that's why you sound like you're angry.

42
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:54,470
隐藏起来 掩饰一会
{\fs14}Hide it. Conceal it for a second.

43
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,220
说得好 掩饰住
{\fs14}Good, conceal it.

44
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:58,840
如果你在北美大陆任何一个地方吃西葫芦
{\fs14}If you eat a zucchini anywhere in mainland north america,

45
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,920
有20%几率你吃到的是我的西葫芦
{\fs14}There's a 20% chance it's one of my zucchini.

46
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,730
嗯 我是西葫芦的脑残粉
{\fs14}Well, I am such a zucchini fan,

47
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,680
我甚至能进行光合作用
{\fs14}I practically photosynthesize.

48
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:08,300
明年这个几率要达到24%
{\fs14}next year I want 24%.

49
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,810
呃 听着 这位dan先生
{\fs14}Well, listen, dan here is the man.

50
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,230
是白宫那边来的新人
{\fs14}He's fresh from the white house,

51
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,850
他有不计其数的
{\fs14}He's got a rolodex as crammed

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,490
和人体藏毒者的粪兜一样多的人脉
{\fs14}As a drug mule's poop pocket.

53
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,800
而且我要把西葫芦提升一个档次
{\fs14}And I want to take zucchini to the next level.

54
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,810
好 明天之前我在城里
{\fs14}Great, I'm in town till tomorrow,

55
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:21,580
今天有什么大人物能让我见见吗?
{\fs14}So any big dogs you can get me in a room with today?

56
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:22,830
这有点棘手
{\fs14}That's gonna be tricky.

57
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,580
大家都出城去开大会了
{\fs14}Everyone's out of town for the convention,

58
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,280
留在特区的只有连锁药店的人而已 但--
{\fs14}So the only people left in dc work at cvs, but--

59
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,080
dan只是谦虚罢了 你认识所有人 对吧 dan？
{\fs14}Dan's just being modest. I mean, you know everybody, right, dan?

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,090
翻翻你的名片盒吧 哥们
{\fs14}Flex that rolodex, pal.

61
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,760
呃 好
{\fs14}Uh, yeah.

62
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:36,510
你听说过jonah ryan吗?
{\fs14}You ever hear of jonah ryan?

63
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,960
-没听过 -我的老哥们 认识很久了
{\fs14}No. Old buddy of mine. We go way back.

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,100
爱死他了 我今天能让你和他见面
{\fs14}Love that guy. I can get you in a room with him today.

65
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,600
好 听着 不谈生意了 吃饭吧
{\fs14}All right, listen. Enough business, let's eat.

66
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,850
好吗? 但不吃西葫芦 怎样?
{\fs14}Okay? But probably not fucking zucchini, right?

67
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,810
我想为把Jason介绍给你们
{\fs14}I'd like to introduce you to jason.

68
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,170
出来 亲爱的
{\fs14}Come on out, honey.

69
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,890
好 现在亲一个
{\fs14}Okay, and now a kiss.

70
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,650
-哦！还得下点功夫 -不止一点功夫
{\fs14}Oh! That needs work. That needs work.

71
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,700
-哪里? -全部
{\fs14}Which part? All of it.

72
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:01,680
-亲别人一下是有多难?-就是说啊
{\fs14}How hard is it to kiss somebody? I know.

73
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,040
你就把头靠近一人
{\fs14}You just put your head close to theirs,

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,200
嘴唇贴一起就行了 对吧?
{\fs14}you let your lips touch, you know?

75
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:06,450
这还需要我示范吗?
{\fs14}Do I need to demonstrate this?

76
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,960
-不需要 -不需要嘛
{\fs14}No. No.

77
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:09,960
好了 他可以自己练习出场
{\fs14}Okay, he can practice the walk on his own time.

78
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,830
我们现在真得核对一下总统的演讲词了
{\fs14}We really need to look at the president's speech now.

79
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,580
这是人类的情感 你不能着急
{\fs14}Hey, human emotion, you can't rush it.

80
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,000
又不是精确的科学 Amy
{\fs14}It's not a precise science, amy.

81
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,880
所有科学都是精确的 这就是科学的意义
{\fs14}All sciences are precise. That's what science means.

82
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,250
这是见仁见智的话题
{\fs14}That's open to interpretation.

83
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,670
对 说得好
{\fs14}Yes. Extraordinary.

84
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,970
夫人 路易安那州有个死刑犯
{\fs14}Ma'am, there's a death row inmate in louisiana.

85
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,010
呃 真不错
{\fs14}Ugh, sounds good.

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,510
他死刑使用了新型的复合毒药
{\fs14}He was given a new drug cocktail,

87
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,730
但不管用 所以基本上他没死
{\fs14}But it didn't work, so basically he's not dead.

88
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,600
-半死不活 -半死不活?
{\fs14}He's half dead. Half dead?

89
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,400
-是 他的死刑被执行了一半 -真可怕
{\fs14}Yeah, he's been half-acuted. Awful.

90
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,430
就像是头被砍掉了但没死
{\fs14}Like being decapitated but surviving.

91
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,220
杀鸡时很常见
{\fs14}Happens to chickens a lot.

92
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,450
呃 有人会说
{\fs14}Well, some might say that

93
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,400
我们才是一群没脑袋的人(缺乏领导)
{\fs14}we're being slightly headless ourselves.

94
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,520
我们应该专注于你的演讲词
{\fs14}We really need to focus on your speech.

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,530
嗯 现在新出的这个死刑的事 应该优先考虑
{\fs14}Well, there is this new execution issue, so that's the priority.

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,990
好 我们是不是该发表一份声明或...
{\fs14}Right. Do you think we should issue a statement or...

97
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:49,910
是 但得是一份如果事情有变就可以调整的声明
{\fs14}Yes, but a statement that can be repurposed if things change.

98
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,900
他死了的声明 没死的声明 或不知死没死的声明
{\fs14}He dies, he doesn't die, or whatever.

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,370
对 很机智 谢谢 谢谢
{\fs14}Yeah, that's very clever. Thank you. Thank you.

100
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,340
所以说这是真的
{\fs14}So it's true.

101
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,010
他们黑了成千上百死亡孩童的数据
{\fs14}They hacked the data of thousands of dead kids

102
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,910
以那些丧子的父母为目标 发放这个煽情的宣传单
{\fs14}To directly target bereaved parents with this charming mailer.

103
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:07,080
哇哦 死孩子-- 从来就不是什么好事
{\fs14}Wow, dead kids-- that never sounds good

104
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,770
除非你是个压力山大的单身妈妈
{\fs14}Unless you're a stressed-out single mom.

105
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,720
出了这事 他们还对我进行民调反对我? 真是够了 我退出
{\fs14}This and they polled against me? That's it, I'm out.

106
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,940
不行 先生 这步棋走错了 你不能--
{\fs14}No, sir, that's the wrong move. You can't--

107
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:16,020
我只接受一个小矮子告诉我该做什么
{\fs14}There's only one midget I'm gonna let tell me what to do,

108
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:18,110
而我现在就去告诉她我受够了
{\fs14}And I'm gonna go tell her that I'm done.

109
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,030
她没时间找人来接你的班
{\fs14}She doesn't have time to replace you.

110
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,900
她要怎么做 给Gary装个丁丁 让他干这个工作吗?
{\fs14}What's she gonna do, pin a dick on gary and give him the job?

111
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,200
她有好几个小时的时间呢
{\fs14}She's got a couple hours.

112
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,120
我是说 在政治里 这时间已经绰绰有余了
{\fs14}I mean, that's more than enough time in politics.

113
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,200
不 等等 并不够 真糟糕哦
{\fs14}No, wait a minute, it's not. Tough shitski.

114
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,710
那么我想对所有年轻人说
{\fs14}so I'd like to say to all you young people,

00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,250

{\fs14}So, really, we wanted to go progressive.

118
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,620
- 夫人 - 啥事?
{\fs14}- Ma'am. - Yeah?

119
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,390
对手阵营里有个我的大学同学 能派的上用场
{\fs14}I have a useful college friend in the enemy camp

120
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,970
没什么脑子 还管不住嘴
{\fs14}With a small brain and a big mouth.

121
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,220
她说Obrien参议员的竞选搭档
{\fs14}She says that senator o'brien's running mate

122
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,810
会是Laura Montez
{\fs14}Is going to be laura montez.

123
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,230
- Montez? - 是的
{\fs14}- Montez? - Yeah.

124
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,230
是那个新上任的墨西哥参议员Laura Montez?
{\fs14}New mexico senator laura montez?

125
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,850
- 嗯哼 - 她很聪明
{\fs14}Mm-hmm. She's brilliant.

126
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,440
很漂亮 又迷人
{\fs14}She's pretty. She's charming.

127
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,490
还是个女人!
{\fs14}She's a woman!

128
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,690
还他妈是少数民族的!
{\fs14}She's fucking ethnic!

129
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,240
这就是拉丁必杀技
{\fs14}This is latina geddon.

130
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,240
我倒希望我是那个在死囚室的人
{\fs14}I wish I was that guy on death row.

131
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,250
他可是连黑胆水都吐出来了啊
{\fs14}Apparently he's vomiting black bile.

132
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,670
- 好吧 我才不在乎 - 这步棋走的太大胆了
{\fs14}- Well, I don't even care. - This is such a bold move.

133
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,780
对手很聪明 这步棋走的确实挺大胆
{\fs14}It's clever. It's a really bold move.

134
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,650
- 是啊 我刚刚就是这么说的 - 好吧
{\fs14}- Yes, that's what I said. - All right.

135
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,540
网上没啥关于Montez的消息可挖
{\fs14}There's nothing on the internet about montez

136
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,120
除了明显用毁图秀秀合成的裸照也没啥东西
{\fs14}Except for the usual photoshopped nudity.

137
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,290
Obrien这次真的难倒我们了
{\fs14}O'brien's really broken us here.

138
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,930
他找了个性感的墨西哥女郎 你们再看看我的人?
{\fs14}He gets sexy mexi. What am I stuck with?

139
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,330
- Doyle? - 白头笑星的无趣老哥哥
{\fs14}- Doyle? - Steve martin's boring older brother.

140
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,270
我是说 现在说这个没什么意义
{\fs14}I mean, it doesn't make any sense to say this,

141
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,690
但是 我真的真的希望摆脱Doyle
{\fs14}But, I mean, I really, really wish we could get rid of doyle.

142
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,010
- 夫人 - 我们要是能把Danny Chung拉到我们这边儿多好?
{\fs14}- Ma'am.-  What if we could put danny chung on the ticket with us?

143
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,280
这样就能干掉他们这场南美狂欢节了 不是吗?
{\fs14}That would totally fuck up that fiesta of theirs, wouldn't it?

144
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,780
夫人 副总统来了 他看起来挺生气
{\fs14}Ma'am, the vice president's here and he looks pissed.

145
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,370
- 比平时更严重 - 你来啦 Andrew
{\fs14}- Even more than usual. - Hi, andrew.

146
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:51,290
女士 我们必须得单独谈谈
{\fs14}Ma'am, we need to have one of those one-on-one conversations.

147
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,520
- 啊哈 - 你懂得 就是你答应了
{\fs14}- Uh-huh. - You know, the kind that you promised

148
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,020
- 我们每周进行一次的那种 - 噢 咄咄逼人哟
{\fs14}- We'd have once a week. Oh, snarky.

149
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,910
好吧 那我们去卧室谈
{\fs14}Okay, yeah. Let's go have a talk in the bedroom.

150
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,080
房间里实在是很脏乱差 你真的不用我先帮你整整--
{\fs14}It's really dirty in there. Do you want me to tidy up just--

151
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,380
哦 我才不在乎 去他的吧
{\fs14}Oh, I don't care. Oh, fuck it.

152
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,370
噢 真抱歉 这里跟炸过似的
{\fs14}Oh, sorry for all this crap everywhere.

153
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,200
- 那么 什么--  - 听我说 Selina
{\fs14}- So, what's--  - hear me out, selina.

154
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,760
我很遗憾地通知你 我要退出竞选了
{\fs14}I regret to inform you that I'm stepping off the ticket.

155
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,830
- 啥? - 整个开幕式我会依然行使副总统的职责
{\fs14}What? I will stay on as veep through the inauguration.

156
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,060
然后我就坐上我的道奇车
{\fs14}Then I am getting in my Dodge

157
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,350
再也不管这堆破事儿了
{\fs14}dodge and I'm getting the hell out of dodge.

158
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,400
我不-- 我是说 你说的都是些啥啊--
{\fs14}I don't-- I mean, what are you talk--

159
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,100
我要气炸了 Ben
{\fs14}I am furious. Ben.

160
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,190
- 咋了? - 你听到他刚说的了吗?
{\fs14}- Yeah? - Are you hearing what I just heard?

161
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:26,020
我不确定是不是听错了
{\fs14}I don't know if I heard correctly.

162
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,690
- 要辞职? - 是这样 他要退出竞选
{\fs14}- Something about resigning? - Yeah, he's stepping off the ticket.

163
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,280
这是出于原则性考虑
{\fs14}It's a matter of principle.

164
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,580
我亲娘的七舅老爷啊
{\fs14}There is no way on god's green cock

165
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,830
你可不能因为原则就退出
{\fs14}That you can get out on matter of principle.

166
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,920
- 是啊 - 你只能说是因为健康状况
{\fs14}- That's right. - It has to be a health issue.

167
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,420
不 我无比健康
{\fs14}No, I'm perfectly healthy.

168
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,840
- 你有前列腺问题 - 我才不会这么说
{\fs14}- You have prostate problems. - I'm not gonna say that.

169
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:44,590
- 太尴尬了 - 那确实 这样才更真实
{\fs14}- That's embarrassing. - Exactly. That's what makes it more real.

170
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:47,430
我不会撒谎的 Selina
{\fs14}I'm not gonna lie, selina.

171
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,290
他说他不会撒谎的 Ben
{\fs14}He said he's not gonna lie, ben.

172
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:54,220
你造吗 副总统办公室那边
{\fs14}You know, there's been some very serious allegations

173
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,600
传出了很严重的性虐指控
{\fs14}Coming from the vice president's office about sexual abuse.

174
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,550
- 再说一遍? - 纳尼?
{\fs14}- Excuse me? - What?

175
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:01,770
- 是的 Jonah Ryan - Jonah? 额滴神啊
{\fs14}- Yeah, jonah ryan. - Jonah? Oh, my god.

可怜的实习生
{\fs14}Those poor interns.

177
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,980
不不不 Jonah是受害者
{\fs14}No, no, no, jonah's the victim.

- 性虐的是你的人Teddy - 纳尼?
{\fs14}- Your man teddy. - What?

179
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,230
是的 他爱抚Jonah蛋蛋的样子
{\fs14}Yeah, he's been fondling jonah's balls

180
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,230
就像是探囊寻宝似得
{\fs14}Like he's trying to figure out what the prize inside is.

181
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,930
我可是一点儿都不知情 Ben 啥都不知道 Selina
{\fs14}I knew nothing about this, ben. Nothing, selina.

182
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,620
- 所以你还怎么做个有原则的人呢... - 是啊
{\fs14}So how can you be a man of principle... Yeah.

186
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,180
是啊 前列腺问题 不是什么原则 对吧?
{\fs14}Yeah, prostate, not principle, huh?

187
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:26,630
是啊 我们会-- 我们会挺过去的

纳尼? 竞选大会开到一半儿要退出?
{\fs14}What? In the middle of a convention?

193
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:38,560
- 我造! - 我们就找Chung来干掉Montez这个小婊砸
{\fs14}- I know! - Chung is our answer to montez.

194
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,680
- 他就是我们的少数民族代表 - 是酱!
{\fs14}- He can be our minority retort. - Yes!

195
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,100
嘿 性虐这招太好用了

你想讨论下我们有谁可选吗?
{\fs14}So do you want to discuss our options?

201
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,780
必须得是Danny Chung
{\fs14}It has to be danny chung.

202
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,360
我刚想这么说
{\fs14}That's exactly what I was gonna say.

203
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:21,160
对吧? 告诉他们 你是怎么回答的

就是 "你愿意做我的竞选伙伴，加入候选人名单吗?"
{\fs14}You know, "Will you join me on the ticket as my running mate?"

216
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,470

{\fs14}It's so nice. Thank you.

260
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,570
kent 好的
{\fs14}Kent. Yes, ma'am

261
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,960
你那有没有纽约时报?
{\fs14}Do you have "The new york times"?

262
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:33,160
我给您找一份 没问题 好的
{\fs14}I can get it for you. Absolutely. Good.

263
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,050
她就问我 能不能在她的胸部签名
{\fs14}So she asked me if I would sign her breast.

264
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,280
我告诉她 "还是签在你手臂上吧?"
{\fs14}I said, "How about I sign your arm?"

265
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:43,120
-Karen  -她说 "那不行 签手臂上谁看啊?"
{\fs14}Karen. She said, "That's no good. Who's gonna see that?"

266
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,840
你现在对我们的团队怎么看?
{\fs14}What do you think about, you know, the group?

267
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,000
我觉得有些人该留
{\fs14}I feel like there are some

268
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,090
有些人该走
{\fs14}people who should be here and some who shouldn't.

269
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,510
总统也是这么想的 哦 那好啊
{\fs14}That's exactly how the president feels. Oh, good.

270
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,900
嗯 所以她授权我 请你离开团队
{\fs14}Yeah, which is why she's asked me to let you go.

271
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,930
真逗 是啊
{\fs14}Interesting. Yeah.

272
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,850
你的香槟里已经下了剧毒的放射性物质
{\fs14}Your champagne's been laced with polonium.

273
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,810
我想说的是 其实没有啦
{\fs14}I mean, not really.

274
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,100
我只是尽量让气氛不那么尴尬而已
{\fs14}It's just to lighten up the moment a little bit.

275
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,940
但是她确实想解雇你
{\fs14}But she definitely wants you to go.

276
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,860
你现在感觉如何?
{\fs14}So how you feeling?

277
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,640
我脑子一片空白
{\fs14}I don't know what to think.

278
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:11,280
这是难免的 你可以走那边--出去的门在那里
{\fs14}Precisely. You can just use that-- the door right there.

279
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,120
好的 好的
{\fs14}Okay. Okay.

280
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:17,170
她走了 总统
{\fs14}all clear, ma'am.

281
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,840
你不必像我一样 冒着生命危险去救人
{\fs14}You don't have to risk your own life to save another like I did

282
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,660
来成为英雄
{\fs14}To join the hero club.

283
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,350
美国人的每一天 都像英雄一样活着
{\fs14}No, every single day americans do something that's heroic.

284
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,430
因为他们相信民主
{\fs14}They live in a democracy.

285
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,190
这才是真正的英雄主义
{\fs14}That's real heroism.

286
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:38,310
嘿 嘿 嘿 哇哦! 谢谢 谢谢

289
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,680

{\fs14}You did?

290
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,870
呃 很有意思的是
{\fs14}Well, you know, it's funny

291
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,620
刚才我们的牙齿撞到一起了
{\fs14}because we actually bumped teeth there.

292
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,200
估计你们错过了
{\fs14}I guess you guys missed it,

293
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,790
不过我们有一生的时间来练习
{\fs14}but we have our whole lives to practice that.

294
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,990
我们坚信不疑
{\fs14}And we will.

295
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,910
小心 别碰着这位男士好么?
{\fs14}You leave this man alone, okay?

296
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,910
这可是我们的宝贝
{\fs14}Precious cargo right here.

297
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,330
谢谢 他是我的拉拉队长
{\fs14}Thank you. Well, he's my cheerleader.

298
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:01,030
我得给他弄点拉拉球来
{\fs14}Yeah, I've got to get him pom-poms.

299
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,550
再次感谢你们的热情
{\fs14}Thank you all so much again.

300
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:06,090
感谢你 美利坚!

302
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,310
你这样不累么?
{\fs14}Do you ever get tired of this?

303
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,210
早就累了 对
{\fs14}Really tired of it, yeah.

304
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,680
我在选择Dolye之前审核过的人?
{\fs14}The people that I vetted before I chose doyle?

305
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,020
-候选人确实不少 -对啊 可惜你都看不上眼啊
{\fs14}-There's so many of them. -Yeah, you didn't like any of them.

306
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,320
不过 此一时非彼一时
{\fs14}Well, that was then, and this is not then.

307
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,740
-投票显示Olsen的人气不错 -他有酗酒的前科
{\fs14}-Olsen polled okay. -He's got a drinking problem.

308
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,810
他有酗酒的前科呢
{\fs14}He's got a drinking problem.

309
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,440
是的 他甚至都不肯让别人借用一下鞋油
{\fs14}Yeah, shoe polish and he never even shared.

310
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,530
我们可以挑女性啊 夫人
{\fs14}Well, we could go all female, ma'am.

311
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,910
-什么? -Leanne Harris
{\fs14}-What? -Leanne harris.

312
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:19,450
你是想要天下大乱吗?
{\fs14}Are you trying to blow up the universe now?

313
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,450
谁想看两个女人捆绑竞选啊?
{\fs14}Who's gonna go for two women on the ticket?

314
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,170
我猜我们还能整天品鲍爽到飞起呢 嗯?
{\fs14}I guess we could all eat pussy all day long, too, right?

315
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,540
Tom James 男性
{\fs14}Tom james is a man.

316
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,870
我们要的是像Tom James这种型的 知道不?
{\fs14}We need a tom jamesy type, you know?

317
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,760
来自南方的拉丁裔
{\fs14}From the south. And latino.

318
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,830
呃 他既不是南方人也不是拉丁裔
{\fs14}Well, he's not southern or latino,

319
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,460
Culverson怎么样?
{\fs14}But what about culverson?

320
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,800
他都86岁了
{\fs14}He's 86.

321
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,220
嗯 这就是为什么不要他的原因 Mike
{\fs14}Yeah, that's why we 86'd him, mike.

322
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:40,880
候选人得活得过竞选吧
{\fs14}The candidate needs to live up to and through the election.

323
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:44,810
-那么还是Tom James? -上帝啊 选一个合适的人有这么难吗?
{\fs14}-Tom james? - God, why is it hard to find somebody for this job?

324
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,220
我是说 这是个多么棒的工作啊
{\fs14}I mean, it is such a great job.

325
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,780
极好的工作 嗯
{\fs14}Such a great job. Yeah.

326
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:53,360
朋友们 我是一个美国能(人)
{\fs14}Folks, I am an ameri-can

327
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,280
我有一个美计划
{\fs14}With a merry plan.

328
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,450
我信奉"吹着口哨上着班"的人生观
{\fs14}I subscribe to a "Whistle while you work" Philosophy.

329
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,240
如果要把这个枪毙掉的话 就别再把他放在中间
{\fs14}If this is supposed to be dead, it shouldn't be in the center.

330
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:04,900
-夫人 夫人 -很明显
{\fs14}-Ma'am. Ma'am. -There's

331
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,210
我们不可能--
{\fs14}absolutely no way we're going to be able to--

332
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,630
夫人 我也不想祥林嫂一直bb
{\fs14}Ma'am, I don't want to sound like a broken record,

333
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,220
不过我要说 选Tom James Tom James Tom James
{\fs14}But tom james, tom james, tom james.

334
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,470
好好 别吵啦 给老娘安静
{\fs14}Okay,stop it. Just stop it.

335
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,720
为什么不选他?
{\fs14}Why not?

336
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,840
Amy 我可不想你误会
{\fs14}Amy, I don't want you to take this the wrong way,

337
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,420
但你确实有点烦人了
{\fs14}But you are being a little irritating.

338
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,090
嗯 或许不只是一点点吧
{\fs14}Well, maybe not a little bit.

339
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,930
可能是非常 没错
{\fs14}A lot a bit. That's right.

340
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,180
-那你选谁? -我不--
{\fs14}-Then who? -I don't--

341
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,760
他?
{\fs14}Him?

342
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:30,220
不!不!艹艹艹 别呀!
{\fs14}No! No! Fuck, no!

343
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,690
我说 他完全不合适 好吗?
{\fs14}Well, he's completely inept, right?

344
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,270
但是你们可以化腐朽为神奇 -确实
{\fs14}But you can make inept work. -True.

345
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,270
一个土豆你都能吹上天
{\fs14}You can say the same of a potato.

346
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:39,240
Ben 去把Pierce给我找来 好吗?
{\fs14}Go get pierce for me, okay, ben?

347
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,780
好 哦...我们要跟他谈谈
{\fs14}Okay. Oh... We should talk to him.

348
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:43,750
我头痛...
{\fs14}My head hurts...

349
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,950
考虑到有这么多奇妙的可能
{\fs14}From all the wondrous possibilities.

350
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,240
Karen 你觉得Pierce怎么样?
{\fs14}Karen, what do you think of pierce?

351
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,870
要我说 每一个候选人都有优缺点
{\fs14}Well, I think there are pros and cons to every candidate,

352
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,210
所以我们需要权衡他们的优缺点
{\fs14}So we just need to weigh up the pros and cons.

353
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,290
你是不是从未来传送过来
{\fs14}Have you been sent from the future

354
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,630
摧毁我的? 真是效果显著啊
{\fs14}To destroy me? 'cause it's working.

355
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,930
"我觉得每个候选者都有优点和缺点
{\fs14}"I think that each candidate has merits and demerits.

356
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,720
我不知道我的左屁股和右屁股哪个更好
{\fs14}And I don't know my left butt cheek from my right butt cheek,

357
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,970
但是我应该听听两瓣屁股的意见
{\fs14}But I believe in listening to both

358
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:05,800
来决定要不要从屁眼里放屁"
{\fs14}butt cheeks and then farting out my asshole mouth."

359
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,560
好吧 这连胡话都算不上
{\fs14}Okay. It's not even bullshit.

360
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,390
能说胡话也需要天赋 你毛都没有
{\fs14}Bullshitting takes talent. You have none.

361
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,980
你个只会逼逼的贱人
{\fs14}You are just a blah, blah, blah, blah bitch.

362
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:16,100
好啦 Amy 够啦
{\fs14}Okay, amy, that is enough.

363
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,320
我一直咬我的舌头来忍着不说话
{\fs14}I have bitten my tongue so long,

364
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:21,400
都要咬成狗啃的垫子了
{\fs14}It looks like a dog's cushion.

365
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,270
但我再也忍不下去了
{\fs14}But no more.

366
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,910
你把这个工作整得无法进行下去
{\fs14}You have made it impossible to do this job.

367
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,460
你只有两个设置选项--没有决策和烂决策
{\fs14}You have two settings-- no decision and bad decision.

368
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,330
我甚至都不会让你一个人
{\fs14}I wouldn't let you run a bath

369
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,920
在没有海岸警卫队和消防部门
{\fs14}Without having the coast guard

370
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,500
在场的情况下去放洗澡水
{\fs14}And the fire department standing by,

371
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,840
但是你却这样管理美国
{\fs14}But yet here you are running america.

372
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:45,430
你的出现是这个国家 自有超大桶装食品以来
{\fs14}You are the worst thing that has happened to this country

373
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,510
最大的悲哀
{\fs14}Since food in buckets

374
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,430
也许还要算上奴隶制
{\fs14}And maybe slavery.

375
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,230
我受够你了 我走人
{\fs14}I've had enough. I'm gone.

376
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,970
呃 我想她已经完成了她小小的--
{\fs14}Well, I guess she's finished with her little--

377
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,440
哦 不
{\fs14}Oh, nope.

378
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,190
看啊 她还没说完呢
{\fs14}Look at that, there's more.

379
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,360
-你一事无成 -好吧
{\fs14}-You have achieved nothing.-Uh-huh.

380
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,160
除了一件事
{\fs14}Apart from one thing.

381
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,120
鉴于你是个女的
{\fs14}The fact that you are a woman

382
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,980
我们将来一定不会再有女总统了
{\fs14}means we will have no more women presidents

383
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,170
因为我们尝试过一个女总统 而她绝逼烂透了
{\fs14}Because we tried one and she fucking sucked.

384
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,840
永别 夫人
{\fs14}Good-bye, ma'am.

385
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,350
哎 这个显然都怪我
{\fs14}Well, that was clearly about me.

386
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
她是典型的憎恶权威型女性的那种女人
{\fs14}She's just one of those women who resents powerful women.

387
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:31,970
天哪
{\fs14}Man.

388
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,230
我要和Tom James会面
{\fs14}I'm gonna want to talk to tom james.

389
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,480
-好 -嗯
{\fs14}-Okay. -Yeah.

390
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,450
-Karen -怎么?
{\fs14}-Karen. -Yes?

391
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,540
你怎么看Tom James这个人?
{\fs14}What do you think of tom james?

392

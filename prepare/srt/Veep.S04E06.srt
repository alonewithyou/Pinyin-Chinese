我会说他是一位超级巨星

你的车比我的大好多
Your bike is a lot bigger than mine.

天 这个镜子不起作用啊

因为是我把话放出去
It's 'cause I sent that press release out

163
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,920
说她辞职了是因为她精神不稳定

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,590
不过 这么说出来就是你的不对了

你能完成这一转变么?"

我真希望我能明白积怨世仇是怎么回事儿
I wish I understood vendettas.

170

有没有搞错 是我在一周以前提议的
Hello, I suggested that a week ago

179
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,620
而我却像是一架经过五角大楼被击落的滑翔机
and I was shot down like a hang glider over the Pentagon.

180
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:36,990
Amy 留在这儿我会给你提供一个非常好的工作机会 好不好?
Amy, I'm offering you an incredible opportunity here, okay?

181

好啦 我希望气氛能有所不同

195
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,960
我想我们对他而言是得到大客户的唯一选择了
then I think we're the ones to get it for him.

196
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,520
你也许可以称之为白宫
Maybe you can refer to it as the White House

197
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,560
因为我们的一些客户
since some of our clients

- Mark Twain说的 - 不 我恨华府
- Mark Twain said that. - No, I hate DC

290
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,350
它把你生吞活剥 再把你拉出来
and it chews you up and it shits you out

291
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,810
然后你就一无所有了
and then you are left with nothing

292
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,320
只剩下冷汗和痛苦的回忆

316
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:59,180

317
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,650

呃 参议员会过来吗？

319
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:05,420
Ryan先生 我们今天请你过来
Mr. Ryan, we asked you here today

320
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:07,890

321
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,620
呃 你说Teddy吗
Uh, Teddy.

322
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:13,230
我们决定对他进行集体诉讼
We're bringing a class action against him

323
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,760
我多么希望你能出庭作证
and we'd like you to testify.

324
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,660
我们都曾经是
We've all been the victims

325
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,930
Teddy性骚扰的受害者
of Teddy's inappropriate sexual behavior.

326
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,930
我是唯一的男……
Am I the only man that he...

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,670
-目前来说是的 -好吧
- As far as we know. - Okay, all right.

328
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,570
很显然 此事有些误会
Well, obviously there has been some sort of mistake here

329
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,340
因为Teddy和我之间发生的事
because what happened between Teddy and I

330
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,910
显然不是我自愿的
was not consensual, obviously.

331
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,780
他用手握...抓...
There was the ball... The cupping...

332

或者说是攥...我的蛋蛋
The grabbing or the... The clutching.

333
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,580
在这儿没有什么和羞愧的 Jonah 尽情倾诉吧
There is no shame here, Jonah. Let it out.

334
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,120
确实没必要羞愧
Oh, I understand there's no shame

335
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:42,290
因为这仅仅是更衣室里无聊的举动而已
because it was locker room tomfoolery and nothing more.

336
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,790
你是说你没有被侵犯吗?
You're saying you weren't assaulted?

337
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,260
先生 你可以不回答这个问题
Sir, you don't have to answer that.

338
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,860
-哦 这个人是你的律师吗? -不是
- Oh, is this man your attorney? - No.

339
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,030
-严格来说不是的 -我们走 现在就走

340
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,700
Teddy现在无法再伤害你了
Teddy can't hurt you now.

341
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:53,100
我不是在担心Teddy 我是在担心你们
I'm not worried about Teddy. I'm worried about you.

342
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,770
我的老天爷啊 你们看起来都跟我一样受
Jesus fucking Christ. You all look like me.

这真是个噩梦
This is a nightmare.

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,940
真他妈是个噩梦
It's a fucking nightmare.

345
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,610
有件事我想问清楚
And just so we're clear,

346
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,020
这真的不是一次面试吗?
at no point was this a job interview?

347
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:14,050
-不是 -好吧 好吧 明白了
- No. - Okay. Okay. Clear,

348
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,160
这可是出乎意料啊
Well, that was unexpected.

349
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,630
是啊 我感觉像是又被人侵犯了 只不过这次是被法律侵犯
Yeah, I feel like I got felt up again, but this time by the law.

350
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,430
告诉我要做什么
Just tell me what I'm doing.

351
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,360
你得处理这次情感上的负面影响...

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,240
哦 对啊 用滴滴 那样最好了 先生
Oh, yeah, no. Uber, that makes the most sense, sir.

356
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,380
Richard 我看起来不像一个中年妇女吧?
Richard, I don't look like a middle-aged woman, do I?

357
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,650
不像 先生
No, sir.

358
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,420
不过 你的那件紫色衬衫确实
Well, you do have that one purple shirt

359
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,480
看着有点像女式的 不过
that looks a bit blousy, but...

Wow, this music is so irritating.

431
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:52,870
天哪 只有你会被伽马波和温顺的鲸鱼惹恼
Jesus, only you could be irritated by gamma waves and a whale.

432
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,780
这只是个抠门的 只提供一丢丢荷荷巴油的瑞士安乐死诊所
This is just a Swiss suicide clinic with a hint of jojoba.

433
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:01,380
Dan 我做了水疗 很管用
Dan, mm-hmm, I did the whole spa thing and it worked.

434
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,750
-我在这儿呆了 差不多... -七分钟
- I have been here, like... - Seven minutes.

435
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,720
七分钟 是的 足够了
Seven minutes. Yeah, it's plenty.

436
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
好 那我们就在你办公室见
Okay, so I'm going to see you at the office.

437
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,890
参议员 你可能已经忘了
You won't remember, Senator,

438
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,420
但是你第一次竞选时是我父亲开车送你去的
but my father drove you when you first ran for office.

439
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,760
-你是George Meredith的儿子 ? -是的
- You're George Meredith's boy? - Yeah.

440
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,060
他近来怎样? 还在酿他的啤酒?
How's he doing? Is he still brewing his own beer?

441
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,430
是的 先生 他酿酒的水平和以前一样
Yes, sir. Still doesn't taste any better.

442
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:22,270
我可以要几份没放牛奶的煎饼么?
Can I get a short stack made without cow's milk?

443
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,170
你没开玩笑吧? 你不想要牛奶还是...?
Are you serious? You don't want milk or...?

444
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,770
不要 摄入牛奶会让我胀气
No, it makes me gassy.

445
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:29,940
我的肠子可能胀得像手袋那么大 这可不太好
Which, when you have a bag instead of a bowel, is not good.

446
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:32,910
Bernie  肠胃怎么样 我的朋友?
Bernie. How's the gut, my friend?

447
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:35,780
还可以忍受 谢谢你还记得
Tolerable. Thanks for remembering.

448

450
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,250

和Lambert参议员关系很好
Got a very strong relationship with Senator Lambert.

454
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,960
当然 没人想毁掉一段好的关系
Sure, and nobody wants to ruin a good relationship.

455
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,900
确实 Lambert好像认识Roger Furlong
No, and Lambert kind of knows Roger Furlong,

456
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,670
他经常和前副总统Doyle一起参加例会
who takes regular meetings with VP Doyle,

457
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
理论上Doyle是能联系到美国总统的

458

-这就是关系链 -看

459
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,340
你想要关系链么? 这就是了 好吧?
you want a chain? Here's the chain, okay?

460
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,440
-我...- 我 美利坚合众国的总统
- Me... - Me, the President of the United States.

461
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,680
美国总统和她团队的
I have the trust of POTUS

462

Well, spoils of war, handsome.

488
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,740
你想要高级客户 多向Amy学习学习 或者超越她
You want top clients, be more like Amy. Or better.

489
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,910
你现在是要把我的停车位
You want to go ahead and give her my parking space

490
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,480
我的办公桌给她吗?

491
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:15,550
现在 听着 Dan 我不想如此不讲理
Now, listen, Dan, I don't want to be unreasonable.

492
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,450
Amy 你想要他得停车位和办公桌吗?
Amy, do you want his parking space and desk?

当然要
Yes, please.

494
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,890
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

495

00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,760
他是煎饼天才
He's this pancake genius

497
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,030
而我却迷失在了一些蜂蜜轶事中
and I got lost in some sort of a bee anecdote.

498
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,860
听我说 你就是碧昂丝
You listen to me. You are Beyoncè.

- Hey, what's going on? - The storm's happening.

502
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,270
夫人 你最好尽快赶回华府 比醉酒超速驾驶要快才行
Ma'am, you've got to get back to DC faster than a speeding drunk.

503
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:43,640
北卡罗来纳州要从版本图上吹跑了?
Is North Carolina about to be blown off the map?

504
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,880
是的 六小时后可以看见奶牛在天上飞
Yeah, six hours till flying cow time.

505
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,050
这是一个潜在的悲剧 但对你来说是个好机会
This is a potential tragedy that could be great for you.

506
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,850
好的

507
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,020

好了 我们扔下Tom返回华府 是吧?

510
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,390
就这样 飓风肯定会来袭
This is it. Hurricane's definitely going to hit.

511
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:02,660
每个人都会从竞选回来
Everyone's gonna be coming back from the campaign

512
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,730
这个地方会再次热闹欢腾起来
and this joint will be jumping again.

513
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:06,870
你可真是兴奋呐 不是吗 Ben?
You are really excited about that, aren't you, Ben?

514
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,500
那是 必然的嘛 我是说 没有冒犯之意 Sue
Hell, yes. I mean, no offense meant, Sue,

515
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,570
只剩下我和你的时候 我感觉世界里只有我
but when it's just you and me, it's like it's just me.

516
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,240
好吧 看起来情况很糟
Okay, it's looking bad.

517
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,510
不论是国家气象局
Both the National Weather Service

518
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,440
还是我的手机应用都这么说
and my app are saying this.

519
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,850
好 我们去华府 我们等待飓风过后
Right, so we'll go to DC, we'll wait for the storm to pass,

520
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,520
就出发去北卡罗来纳州
and then we'll head to North Carolina.

521
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:26,790
或者在飓风来袭之前到达那儿
Or go there right now before it hits.

522
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:29,450
疯了吧你
That's crazy.

523
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,960
只要飓风一过
Soon as the hurricane has passed,

524
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,020
你就正好在当地民众需要你的时刻出现了
you're right there with the people in their hour of need.

525
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,130
他疯了
He's crazy.

526
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,330
-我喜欢这提议 -你呐?
- I love that. - Do you?

527
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,630
这就是你主宰灾难的方式
That's the way you master a disaster.

528
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,330
嘿 夫人 我有些问题
Hey, ma'am, I've got some issues here.

529
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:44,970
这可是飓风 就像是 夺命风暴
It's a hurricane, and that's, like, killer wind.

530
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,560
好 我们改变航线
Okay, we're turning this plane around,

531
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,870
直接朝北卡罗来纳州进发
we're heading to North Carolina.

532
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,750
我们州若是处于紧急预警状态
A state of emergency in my state

533
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,750
我们会关闭所有航班行程 损失上百万
would shut down travel, cost millions.

534
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,120
能等几个小时吗?
Can we wait a few hours?

535
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,950
抱歉 我们可没有几个小时来等
Well, we don't have a few hours.

536
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,420
那是James参议员吗?
Is that Senator James?

537
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,320
-嗨 -嗨 Cecile
- Hi. - Hi, Cecile.

538
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,660
是他们把视频对比度调到最大了
Either they have the contrast turned up to max

539
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,360
还是说你的气色本来就这么棒
or you are looking fine.

540
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,560
哦
Oh.

541
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,060
-我们要不...? -哦 对 当然
- Should we...? - Oh, yes, of course.

542
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,670
州长 我肯定你能理解
Governor, I'm sure you'll understand,

543
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,740
我们有些关于国家安全的问题
we have some issues of national security

544
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,000
需要讨论一下下
that have to be discussed.

545
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:21,540
我本来要谈妥了
I have had it

546
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,540
但一看见她那五官分家的脸
with her category five fucking snoot.

547
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,910
我就...她肯定听不见我们说话是吧?
And... she definitely can't hear us?

548
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:31,680
-听不见 -或许她会读唇语
- No. - Maybe she can lip-read.

549
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,350
好吧 呃...
Okay, um...

550
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,320
我们把椅子转一个角度吧
let's just swivel the chairs.

551
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,400
老天爷噜
Jesus Christ.

552
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:46,260
-她知道我们听得见不是吗? -我觉得她并不知道
- She know that we can hear that? - My guess would be no.

553
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,030
-我收到Ben的一条短信 -他说什么?
- I got a text from Ben. - What did he say?

554
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:52,570
-他说什么? -他说他啥都听不见
- What did he say? - He says he can't hear anything.

555
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,740
给他回复
Just text him back.

556
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:57,210
看见没 如果封锁航班开始实施
See, I think it would be unfair

557
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:59,580
对于参议员O'Brien和他的竞选伙伴而言
on Senator O'Brien and his running mate

558
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:01,310
这个肯定是不公平的
if there were a travel lockdown

559
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,680
因为他们会被困在弗罗里达
because they would be stranded in Florida.

560
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,820
他们不像我们一样可以亲赴灾害现场慰问
They would not be able to visit the disaster site like we could.

561
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:10,660
就让他们随烧烤酱汁而去吧
Just throwing that into the barbecue sauce.

562
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,920
好的
Right.

563
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,900
坏了 这椅子...
It doesn't work. The chair...

564
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,070
州长 我很遗憾告诉您
Governor, it pains me to say this.

565
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,670
我们会在你的机场降落
I think we're gonna have to ground flights

566
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:27,470
尽管你反对我们这么做
despite your opinion on this matter.

567
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,380
Cecile 如果你能够发出紧急预警的话
Cecile, if a state of emergency were requested,

568
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,810
我想一份来自联邦资金的绵薄之力可以成为你们的甘露
that could be sweetened by a light dusting of federal funds.

569
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,090
好的 我决定发表声明处于紧急预备状态
Okay, I've decided to request a state of emergency.

570
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,890
谢谢你 州长
Thank you, Governor.

571
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,820
咋样啊?
How about that?

572
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,630
-看看呀 放一万个心啊 -看起来奏效了
- Look at that. Put it here. - Seemed to work.

573
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,960
-你知道你是什么吗? -什么?
- You know what you are? - What?

574
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,030
我的明智之选
A great choice that I made.

575
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:57,340
好吧 让我们去追逐风暴吧 小婊砸
Okay, let's go storm-chasing, you shitkickers.

576
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,510
这不是飓风 那到底特么是什么?
This isn't a hurricane. What the hell is this?

577
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,980
我的应用上说是和风
My app says moderate breeze.

578
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,810
这些树都没有倒下
These trees are still standing.

579
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:09,350
我不想看到这些屹立不倒的树
I don't want to look at standing trees.

580
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:12,470
- 我想说 我的风暴去哪儿了? - 它转向去南边了
- I mean, where is my storm? - It veered south.

581
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,320
- 怎么会这样? - 气压原因
- How? - Barometric pressure.

582
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,160
Mike你那个应用怎么搞得?
How about that app of yours, Mike?

583
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:18,380
你最好把你花在那上面的钱讨回来
You better get your money back on that one.

584
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,920
它其实免费的
It was actually free.

585
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,310
我更新了软件之后它就出现在我的屏幕上了
I updated my software and it just appeared on my screen.

586
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,030
然后我就 "这是个啥" 接着我就用了
And I was like, "What is this thing?" And I just picked it up.

587
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,190
所以这个风暴现在在往哪儿走?
Where's the storm heading now?

588
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,260
- 佛罗里达州 - 佛罗里达州
- Florida. - Florida.

589
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:32,130
所以O'Brien和Montez
So O'Brien and Montez

590
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,440
会去拍摄风暴照片? 你是这个意思么?
are gonna get the storm photos? Is that what you're saying?

591
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:36,910
当时我提出的时候这还绝对是个好主意
This was definitely a good idea when I pitched it.

592
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,980
好吧 我延迟了一堆航班
Well, I grounded flights

593
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,210
而且还把政府救助金送去了别的州
and I diverted federal funds to the wrong state.

594
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:45,700
我怎么不记得你当时提到这个可能性呢 Tom
I don't remember you pitching that as a possibility, Tom.

595
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,150
有时候你需要赌一把运气
Sometimes you have to gamble.

596
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:49,250
不幸的是 我们的马没有赢
Unfortunately, our horse did not win.

597
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,690
对啊 肯定没赢
No, it certainly didn't.

598
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,760
它跨第一个栏的时候就绊倒了然后被一枪毙了
It fell at the first fence and it got shot.

599
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,830
然后现在一群法国渣渣把它塞进法式长棍了
And now some French fucker's got it in a baguette.

600
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,220
你以后别给我拿竞选
Don't you gamble with this campaign

601
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,760
和我的总统位置赌运气 好吗 Tom?
and this presidency, okay, Tom?

602
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:03,540
- 我做错的太多 说话太不过脑子了 我道歉 -对 嗯哼
- Too much too soon. I apologize. - Right. Mm-hmm.

603
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,340
- Ryan先生 - 干什么?
- Mr. Ryan. - Yeah?

604
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:09,770
来自内阁事务的Louise Benjamin到了 想和您见面

607
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,220
- 你好 - 嘿 这是个笑话么?
- Hello. - Hi. Is this a joke?

608
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,750
- 什么? - 说实话 你为啥会在这儿啊?
- I'm sorry? - Honestly, why are you here?

609
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,920
我在核对机构的回应...
I'm collating agency responses...

610
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,720
- 你多高? - 什么?
- How tall are you? - What?

611
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,330
抱歉 女士
I am sorry, ma'am.

612
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,400
很多高个子女人都被骚扰了
A number of tall women were molested

613
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,430
然后Ryan先生也是其中之一
and Mr. Ryan was one of them.

614
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,450
好吧 这是一次竞选访问么?
Okay, and this is a campaigning visit?

615
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,200
是的 你在这里的身份是候选人 而不是总统
Yes, you're here as a candidate, not president.

616
00:25:35,230 --> 00:25:36,750
好吧 那这些人在这儿干啥的
Okay, and what do they do here?

617
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,740
浇筑建筑装饰
Embossed and dentil moulding.

618
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,540
- 哦噢 啥? - 我也不知道
- Uh-huh. Huh? - No idea.

619
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,270
女士 我们还组织了一个制蛋工厂(茄子)的访问
Ma'am, we've also set up a tour of an egg plant.

620
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:45,980
我指包装鸡蛋的一个工厂 不是那个大型的植物
I mean a plant that packs eggs, not the big vegetable.

621
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:48,100
- 哦 我明白了 - 感谢解释
- Oh, I see. - Thanks for clarifying.

622
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,410
- 不用谢 - 你好
- You're welcome. - Hello.

623
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,550

- Madam President. - Yes.

624

00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,630
我们本来希望带你去看看工厂
We were hoping to give you a tour of the plant,

626
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:59,210
但是我们工厂在风暴中受到了一些破坏
but we sustained some damage in the storm and it's not safe.

627
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:01,510
哦! 哦 那么...
Oh! Oh, well...

628
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,770
我们也会想去看看的 Kent 咱们走

抱歉 还有其他什么的 回车里去
Apologies, et cetera. Back in the car.

630
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,630
这是总统访问 不能看起来像竞选
This is presidential. Can't look like campaigning.

631
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,570
Nick
Nick.

632
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:17,340
没 我正准备躲到车后面去
Nope, I'm gonna be hiding in the back of a car.

633
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,980
我知道 传记都会自成章节
I know. Biography just writes itself.

634
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,450
我们来看看
Let's get a look.

635
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,450
嗯 这个屋顶受到了一些破坏
Well, this roof sustained some damage.

636
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:26,120
哦 嗯哼
Oh. Uh-huh.

637
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,650
这才不叫破坏
This isn't damage.

638
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,720
- 就是些豆腐渣建筑而已 - 嗯哼
- Just some shitty building. - Mm-hmm.

639
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,490
哦 天啊
Oh, God.

640
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,460
O'Brien刚刚从一个房子废墟里拽出一只泰迪熊
O'Brien just pulled a teddy bear out of the ruins of a house.

641
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,050
好 180度大逆转
Okay, complete 180.

642
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,460
这是个竞选访问 把Tom弄过来
This is a campaign visit. Go get Tom now.

643
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,030
- 啊咳! - 你想给我点防晒霜么?
- Ahem! - Want to give me some sunscreen?

644
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,690
- 是啊 - 这外面这么晒
- Yeah. - It's pretty bright out.

645

It is so bright out.

646
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,070
- 对吧? - 对 夫人

It's a campaign visit again.

648
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,500
嘿 你知道没?
Hey. You see?

649
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,020
总统级别的活动又是另外一回事了
It's a different ball game on a presidential level.

650
00:26:59,060 --> 00:27:00,720
迷人气质也就帮你到这儿了
Charm only gets you so far.

651
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,520
你是对的 夫人 还有很多其他的...
You're right, ma'am. There's a lot more to...

我基本上是修建房子的边角装饰
I basically cut hard dentil mouldings.

657

你就是那种我一直想找的人
You're the guy I've been looking for.

我已经在这里工作17年了 夫人

- 那这是太华丽了 不是么? - 的确
- It's too ornate, right? - Exactly.

667
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,160
你不会想做这玩意的 我知道我不会
You don't want to do it. I know I don't.

668
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:42,840
嘿 我得打断你了
Hey, I'm gonna have to cut you off.

你不用跟他们再打招呼了
You don't have to say hi to them.

672
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,770
我们已经和他们打过招呼了 快走
We've already said hi to these folks. Come on.

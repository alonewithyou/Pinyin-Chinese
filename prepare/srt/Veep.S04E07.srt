今晚我要和以前的小帮派重聚
I'm getting the old gang back together.

你是怎么加入这个帮派的?
How did you get into this gang?

48
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:11,860
是不是得杀个人当投名状?
Did you have to kill a guy?

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,190
你现在可以总统赦免自己了

要知道 作为女性 实际上这事早就搞定了

这里说开枪者是退伍海军
It says here the gunman was an ex-Marine.

59
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,850
本该保家卫国却去伤害民众 真是悲哀

67
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,650
我从来没想到我会来为混凝土游说
I never thought I'd be lobbying for concrete.

68
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,070
-挺好的 不是吗? -是

If I keep going at this rate, I'm gonna have gout of the mouth.

像你们这样独立自主 接受过良好教育
Independent, well-educated young women like you

性感热辣的年轻女性 能把议员们引诱到小黑屋里去
who also happen to be very hot to lure congressmen into the room

77
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:22,430
在某种方面来讲 这就是女权主义

78
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,430
紧接着我们会介绍我们的客户 他们做成买卖
We then introduce our client, who makes a sale

79

从某种方面来讲 这就是资本主义

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,770
我不需要和任何人”做”任何事 对吧?
I'm not expected to do anything with anyone, am I?

这是游说 是个值得尊敬的职业

我们是在和粘土打仗么?
Are we at war with clay?

88

修建墨西哥边境的混凝土墙 这就是生存之道

简直太浪了 不是吗？
It's so slutty, isn't it?

97
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,480
这儿就是个招幌飘扬的毛片现场
This place is like a porn shoot with bunting.

98

妈咪Meyer法案是否注定失败?
The Mommy Meyer Bill. Is it doomed?

102
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,870
首先 这不是妈咪Meyer法案
First off, it's not the Mommy Meyer Bill.

103
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,040
这是家庭第一...不 这是Meyer法案
It is the Families First... No, it's the Meyer Bill.

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,660
它和我对甜甜圈的爱一样注定持久
- And it's about as doomed as my donut habit.

105
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:29,500
我们能先讨论下家庭第一法案吗?
Shall we talk about Families First, please?

106
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:32,470
-对 -我怀疑它会钉在山上的耻辱柱上
- Yeah. - I'm afraid it's getting crucified on the Hill.

107
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,970
-就像耶稣一样 -这是我的重要法案啊
- Just like that Jesus guy. - Well, it's my big bill.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,020
难道你认为我会说 这个
You think I'm just gonna say it

109
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,750
不适合 然后把它拿到淘宝上当二手卖掉吧
doesn't fit and put it up on craigslist or  something?

110
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,010
奥布莱恩议员说 如果家庭第一法案通过了
O'Brien just said, "If Families First is passed,

111
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,430
家庭的整个概念都会终结
the whole concept of family will come to an end."

112
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,980
这肯定是我们的梦想啊
Well, that's the dream, certainly,

113
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,850
但我不确定是否能在这一代实现
but I'm not sure we'll achieve it in this generation.

114
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,430
我不管奥布莱恩是不是讨厌它
I don't care if O'Brien hates it.

115
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,100
这是为了那些喜欢它的人制定的
It's for the people and they love it.

116
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,440
-对对对 但还是不对 –啥?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Except no. - I'm sorry?

117
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,690
我不想说我最接地气了
I hate to be the I'm-in-touch-with- the- normal-guy guy,

118
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,690
但我确实是 普通人只愿意
but I am that guy, and they want to pay

119
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:00,360
为他们自己的而不是其他人的家庭付出
for their families and not other people's.

120
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,200
这可帮不上...
That's not helpful to...

121
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:02,970
-什么? 怎么了?

What? I mean, okay. I mean, what?

125
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,760
我可没料到这事 这是我没料到
I had not anticipated this. This I had not anticipated.

126
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,290
婴幼儿读物都比你会造句 (苏斯博士 《戴帽子的猫》作者)
Well, that sounds like the world's worst Dr. Seuss book.

127
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,010
灵活的时间对大家都有利
Flexible hours benefit everyone.

128

呆在原地别动
Stay exactly where you are.

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,550
好的  全面封锁吧 没人动 就没人受伤
Okay, lockdown. Nobody move and nobody gets hurt.

132
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,770
我们现在不应该是在去地下密室的电梯中吗?
Shouldn't we be on an elevator to a secret bunker by now?

133
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,890
这里没有电梯 也没密室
There is no elevator or bunker.

134
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,890
为什么这里没有一个通向密室的电梯?
Why isn't there an elevator to a secret bunker?

135
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:32,860
上帝啊 Bill
Jesus Christ, Bill,

136
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,110
你筛糠得跟一条在坑里使劲拉屎的狗一样
you're shaking like a dog shitting a peach pit.

137

我真心觉得我应该有一把枪
I actually think I should have a gun.

138
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,620
我并没有在说笑 我是真的需要一把枪
I'm not making a joke. I really would like to have a gun.

-我们需要找到一个更安全的房间

那个入侵者就在那儿!
The intruder! Right there!

144
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,130
我的天 一语成谶! 一语成谶! 一语成谶啊!

抱歉 我要出去透透气
Okay, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go breathe.

151
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,560
-你听到了那些喊叫声了吗? -我听到了
- Selina: Yeah, did you hear all that shouting? - I did.

152
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,230
他在说什么? 你听到他说什么了吗?
What was he saying? Did you hear what he was saying?

153
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,310
谁介意他说了啥? 那家伙蛇精病脑子有包
Who cares what he said? The guy's nutso-bismol.

154
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:09,760
他说了什么?
What was he saying?

155
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,070
他说  让我起来
He said, "Let me up.

156
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,100
我想杀掉Tom James和那个贱人
I want to kill Tom James and that bitch."

157
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:16,600
他来这就是为了杀我
He comes here to kill me

158
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,490
却连我的名字都不知道?
and he doesn't even know my name?

159
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,270
-他可能是说Kent吧 -谢谢
- He may have been talking about Kent. - Thank you.

160
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,190
我得去好好尿一大泡
I've got to take a gigantic whiz.

161
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,950
老天 这个入侵事件把我吓尿了
Man, the siege stuff goes straight to my bladder.

162
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:28,170
就像是狗吐人言那样的惊吓
It's like if dogs could talk.

163
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,500
好了议员 我要去准备你的市政厅会议了
Okay, Senator, I am going to set up your town hall meeting.

00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,460
-哇哦 -你现在怎么样?

167
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,300
我不敢相信有人会来这儿刺杀我
I cannot believe that somebody came here to kill me.

168
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,430
和你
And you.

169
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,630

Still, you know, you've got good people around you.

171
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,220
-对 –天!了!噜!啊!

172
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,310
-我看到他了! 那个入侵者 -你看到啦?
- I saw him! The guy. - You did?

173
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,810
我直接面对他  然后我就
I was face-to-face with him and I was like,

174
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,560
"后退 哥们  别惹毛我"
"Back off, man. Don't mess with this."

175
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,950
-真的吗? -我的肾上腺素已经飚的不行了
- Really? - I have got so much adrenaline in me.

176
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,150
我感觉我必须做点儿什么
It's like I've got to do something.

177
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,290
-你能给我弄些咖啡吗? -好的
- Can you get me a coffee? - Yeah. Yeah.

178
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,150
-加酒的爱尔兰咖啡 没问题!
- An Irish coffee. - Yeah!

179
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,540
- 您要点什么吗? - 不用了
- Do you want something? - I'm good.

180
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,460
- 好 好 好   - 嗯!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Mmm!

181
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,240
- 他跟我很久了 - 是吗?
- He's been with me a long time. - Has he?

182
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,580
- 嗯 嗯   - 看得出来
- Yeah. Yeah. - I see.

183
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,000
嘿 Kim
Hey, Kim.

184
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,920
距离Tom James市政厅活动一小时

185
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,130
嗨 你在哪儿呢? 能不能确保这些旗子
Hi, where are you? Can we make sure that the flags

186
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,330
和幕布对称呢?
are symmetrical to the backdrop?

187
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,670
看起来有点偏了
It looks a little bit off.

188
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,670
顺便说一句 这件T恤很显你身材
That shirt really compliments your figure, by the way.

189
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,970
就是想小小赞扬一下你
Just a nice little compliment for you.

190
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,840
我喜欢这感觉 太棒了
I'm loving this. This is great.

191
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:30,430
- 没错 我们干得漂亮啊  嘿 灯光师 - 干嘛?
- Yeah, we're killing this. Hey, lighting. - What?

192
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,350
嗨 进展如何? 能把灯光稍微调暗一点点吗?
Hi, how's it going? Can we bring these down just a little bit?

193
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,520
好吧 似乎这效果有点过头了
Okay, I think that's a little bit too much drama,

194
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,070
或许我们可以再往回调一点点
so maybe we just bring those back up just a little bit.

195
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,070
很好 嗯 记下它
That looks great. Yeah, mark that.

196
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:43,270
这跟之前的有毛线区别啊 傻×
That's exactly how it was, dumbass.

197
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,990
额 好吧 虽然我们不爆粗口 但还是谢谢了
Okay, well, we don't need that kind of language, but thank you.

198
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,910
一 二 三 四
One, two, three, four.

199
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,250
来点带爆破音的词
Hit me with the plosives.

200
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,950
破  猪 奔 跑
Bring back my pig.

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
- 听起来很爽 - 嗯 是挺不错
- I'm happy with that. - Yeah, that sounds great.

202
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,870
我不想自夸的
I don't want to pat myself on the back,

203
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,290
但我这想法真不错
but this is a great idea on my part.

204
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,040
想想 离开办公室 参加竞选
You know, getting out of the office, going on the campaign trail.

205
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,960
对 还让你忘掉被骚扰这事
Yeah, help you forget about being molested.

206
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,260
声音略大 抱歉
That's loud. I'm sorry.

207
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,930
嗯 呃...额 不
Yeah, well... Well, no.

208
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,180
只是这里所有人都在仰望我们
It's just that everybody thinks we're awesome here.

209
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,140
我是说 我们就是白宫精英 我们就是神一般的存在
I mean, we're West Wing. We're like gods.

210
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,100
Ryan同志 我的生鱼片拿来了没?
Mr. Ryan, did you get my sashimi?

211
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,190
还没 先生 我马上去拿
No, sir, I will get it right now.

212
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,220
必须把它保持在室温
It needs to be at room temperature,

213
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,780
不然只有满嘴冰味
otherwise it just tastes of cold.

214
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:20,890
好的
Yes.

215
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,530
生-鱼-片
Sa-shi-mi.

216
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,570
- 你们听到了没? -寿司
- Are you hearing this? - Sushi.

217
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,120
注意听"shus"和"mis"
Listen to the shus and the mis.

218
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,740
打扰一下 你们在笑些什么呢?
Wait a minute. What are we laughing at here?

219
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,080
看来有人很是花了心思啊
Someone sure put a lot of effort into that.

220
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,250
不明白笑点在哪
I don't get it.

221
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,500
噢 鸭子叫 因为我鸭埋跌了(闪避)
Oh, duck 'cause I ducked.

222
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,670
很有创意 很有趣
Very clever. Very funny.

223
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,590
我也笑得很嗨
I'm laughing, too.

224
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,760
嗯
Yeah.

225
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,180
老妈 你一会儿得一个
Mom, some days you get an award

226
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,010
我听都没听过的国家的奖
from a country I've never even heard of,

227
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,730
一会儿有人想杀你
then other days people try to kill you.

228
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,430
几乎天天有人想杀我 宝贝
People probably try to kill me most days, sweetie.

229
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:02,190
别管它就是了
You just have to shut it out.

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,610
嘿 我把你今晚和朋友聚餐的菜单拿来了
Hey, I've got the menu for tonight's dinner with your friends.

231
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,940
我可喜欢试吃菜单了
I do love tasting menus.

232
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,860
能看着这一长串菜名
It's so nice to be able to look at a list of food

233
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,660
然后说"全点了" 感觉真好
and say, "I'll take all of it."

234
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:13,280
哎 别 我只是想逃避一小会儿
Um, no. I just want to hang back

235
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,450
和姐妹们过个慵懒的晚上 懂不?
and have a loose night with the ladies, okay?

236
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,830
披萨就够了
So let's just get pizza.

237
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,790
那来个创意披萨怎么样?
How about a play on pizza?

238
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,200
- 我们可以分个层什么的... - 不要 不
- We could kind of layer... - No. Uh-uh. No.

239
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,770
或者来个开胃菜
Or we could do an "Antipasta"

240
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,760
我们可以做披萨块
And we could do a deconstructed pizza.

241
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:27,010
好了 你知道我今晚差点被谋杀了吧
Okay, you know I almost got assassinated  today, right?

242
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,200
- 对 没错 - 所以我
- Yeah, you did. - So I

243
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,550
唯一的要求就是你原原本本按我说的做
just need you to do what I'm telling you

244
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,630
啊哈
Uh-huh.

245
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,970
伙计们 这是Aiden Grant
Guys, I want you to meet Aiden Grant.

246
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,100
赢得了
He's the gentleman that won

247
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,890
之前墨西哥边境围栏合同的先生
the previous Mexican border fence contract.

248
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,690
哇哦 你肯定很幸福 也很富有
Wow, you must be very happy and rich.

249
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,310
- 嗯 是
- Yes, I am.

250
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,060
那他肯定也想再赢一次了
So of course he would like to win the new one,

251
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,030
也就是说他得和议员Martin谈谈
which means he needs to speak to Congressman Martin,

252
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,820
但不是现在扯旗的他
but not his obvious erection.

253
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,120
- 啊 没错 - 那...
- Ah, yes. - So...

254
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,650
啊 想想年轻个20岁吧 是吧?
Ah, to be 20 years younger, right?

255
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,410
- 那时我还穿着尿布呢 - 噢 傻眼了吧
- I would be in diapers. - Oh, snap.

256
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,040
好吧 你看 关键就是在他真的骚扰之前
Okay, you see, the key is to jump in

257
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,320
打断他
before it becomes an actual assault.

258
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,490
- 我想我们错过时机了 - 议员先生
- I think we missed the window. - Congressman.

259
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,410
我能看出来你和我们一样
I can see you are as excited about the advancements

260
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,300
对这次坚挺(混凝土)技术的进步感到激动啊
in concrete technology as we are.

261
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:07,630
我想介绍Aiden Grant先生给您认识
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Aiden Grant.

262
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,550
看 就像这样
Look, it's like this.

263
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,510
缺乏教育和贫穷之间
There is a link... There is a proven link

264
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,920
存在着切实的联系
between the lack of education and poverty,

265
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,560
贫穷和犯罪之间也是如此
and between poverty and crime.

266
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,560
而家庭第一提案能打破这种关联
Families First will break that link.

267
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,760
他卓绝群伦
He's nailing it,

268
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,570
就像芭芭拉·史翠珊唱高音C一样不费力
like Streisand hitting a high C.

269
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,150
我的天 你在哪出生的 基佬湖吗?(美国人相信男同志都爱芭芭拉)
My God, where were you born, Lake Homo?

270
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,070
今早匹兹堡发生枪击案后
After the shootings in Pittsburgh this morning,

271
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,330
你认为是时候严格控制枪支了吗？
do you think that it's time for some stricter gun control?

272
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
应对措施很简单
Reaction is easy.

273
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,870
真正理解却很难
Understanding is hard.

274
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,370
凶手难道不也是一位受害者吗？
Wasn't the shooter also a victim?

275
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,760
我们所讨论的可是一位退役海军
Well, we're talking about an ex-Marine here,

276
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:49,680
一位效力祖国时 精神受到创伤的人
someone whose mind was maimed in the service of his country.

277
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,380
Ben Tom James刚才说凶手也是受害者
Ben, Tom James has just said the shooter is a victim, too.

278
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:56,350
-创伤后应激障碍 -哦 天啊
- PTSD. - Oh, my God!

279
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:59,050
灾星James 我不用想就说出这个名字了
Calamity James. And that's just off the top of my head.

280
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,940
-我该怎么做？ -把他拉下来啊 你特么干站着是假人么
- Well, what do I do? - Just get him off, you fucking mannequin.

281
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,470
Jonah
Jonah.

282
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,730
呃 让他停下来 让他闭嘴
Uh, get him to stop. Get him to stop talking.

283
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:10,230
我并不是说我不会谴责今天发生的事 我会的
I'm not saying I don't condemn what happened. I do.

284
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,200
-谴责本身就是… -你他妈在干什么？
- Condemnation on its own... - What the fuck are you doing?

285
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:13,980
这样看起来像是在提醒他整理领带
It looks like you're telling him to straighten his tie.

286
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,740
我的意思是我们需要去理解…
What I'm saying is we need to understand...

287
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,740
你们两个没事吧
Are you guys okay?

288
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,540
你们是要在路边拦车吗？ 什么情况？
Are you trying to hitch a ride? What is that?

289
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,540
-不是 你很棒 你很棒 -不是 怎么回事 哥们？
- No, you're good. You're good. - No, what the fuck, dude?

290
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,660
是啊 是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,750
如果我们要…
If we're gonna take anything...

292
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,750
要不然我们放退场音乐吧
Maybe we could play some exit music

293
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,580
或者按下按钮把气球放下来
or maybe push the button that drops the balloons.

294
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,420
卧槽 好主意 把气球放下来
Shit, that's a great idea. Drop the balloons.

295
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,340
-准备气球了吗？ -没有 我只是举个例子
- Do we have balloons? - No. That was just an example.

296
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,890
既然没准备气球 你他妈为什么要提气球的事？
Why the fuck did you bring up balloons if we don't have them?

297
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,260
我只是脑洞开了一下
Well, just... I was brainstorming.

298
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,930
女士 记者们已经准备就绪
Ma'am, the press are primed.

299
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:44,260
好的 我开头打算这样说
Good. So I thought I would open with this.

300
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,830
我打算说 “这是
I thought I would say, "So I'm

301
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,230
我今天第二次成为摄机目标了”
in the firing line for the second time today."

302
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,940
很搞笑 女士
Hilarious, ma'am.

303
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,190
-是啊 我知道 并不是很好笑 -不是 我说话语气就这样
- Yeah, I know, it's not that funny. - No, it's just my voice.

304
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,270
-我总是让人觉得是在挖苦 -哦
- I always end up sounding sarcastic. - Oh.

305
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:57,740
-Gary Gary -什么情况 怎么了？
- Gary! Gary! - What's going on? What?

306
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,060
别让她走出去
Don't let her go out there.

307
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,780
怎么 出什么问题了吗？
What? What? Is there something wrong?

308
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:03,080
-怎么了 什么情况？ -我说了别让她走出去
- What? What's wrong? - I said don't let her go out there.

309
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,340
神啊 跟我来
Jesus! Come with me.

310
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,290
Tom James刚才大嘴秃噜到了脚底下了
Tom James just shot his mouth off into his foot.

311
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,390
先让她在上面呆个一分钟
Let her up there for a minute,

312
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,260
然后你就上去接受唇枪舌剑
and then you've got to go up there and take the heat.

313
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:12,830
总统女士 您能
Madam President, can you

314
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,510
确定刚才您所受到的危险等级是多少吗？
quantify what level of danger you were in?

315
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:16,640
我总是觉得 好像
I always feel as if I'm

316
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,770
我站在你们面前更危险
in more danger when I'm in front of you guys.

317
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,550
这可是我今天
This is the second time

318
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,300
第二次站在摄机小队面前了
I'm in front of the firing squad today.

319
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:26,640
我真的很感谢
I'm certainly very grateful for the rapid response

320
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,530
特勤队的快速反应
of the Secret Service.

321
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,980
呃 他们处理了那个闯入者
They... they got rid of the intruder...

322
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,610
很安静地处理
s-silently.

323
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:36,530
那么 我们继续
So, um, moving on.

324
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,240
这个季度的就业数据真的很鼓舞人心啊 同志们
These job figures for this quarter are very encouraging, folks.

325
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,740
我很满意
I'm quite pleased with that.

326
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,880
很遗憾 我只有这么多时间
Unfortunately that is all the time I have.

327
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:48,660
Mike 是的 我…
Mike, yeah. I'm good.

328
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,160
我现在要鸭埋跌(闪)了
I'm gonna duck out for now.

329
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:55,000
-被你抓着小辫子了 -是啊
- You got me. - Yeah, I did.

330
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,640
接手吧 你这个小傻蛋
So you can take over, you bozo.

331
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,470
刚才大家都很愉快啊 是吧
We have a good time here, don't we?

332
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:03,310
Mike 我刚得到消息 Tom James说
Mike, I'm just hearing that Tom James has said

333
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,980
匹兹堡的凶手
that the shooter in Pittsburgh

334
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,010
和他杀的那些人一样也是受害者
is as much a victim as those he murdered.

335
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,430
你支持这一观点吗？
Do you support that view?

336
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,240
很明显
That is obviously...

337
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:15,320
非常清楚的是… 我们的观点…
What is clear... That our view...

338
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,660
是我们不支持他的观点
Is we don't support that view.

339
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,030
让我们具体分析一下参议员的话
Let... let's start with putting the senator's words

340
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,670
好吗？
in perspective, okay?

341
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,330
嗯
Um...

342
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,370
呃
uh...

343
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,870
语言并不能杀人
words don't kill people,

344
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,840
枪却不一样
unlike guns,

345
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,540
不仅可以而且也杀了人
which can and did.

346
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:40,300
这是很不好的事 非常不好
Which is bad. It's so bad.

347
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,880
我可以继续
I could go on.

348
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,720
Reece议员几乎就是个瞎子
Congressman Reece is practically blind,

349
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,600
所以你得近距离大动作地挑逗他
so you're gonna have to flirt close and flirt big.

350
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,190
或者 你知道 做些像盲文似的摸摸的事
Or, you know, do some kind of braille  thing.

351
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,720
我可是有政治学学历的 没问题的
I've got a degree in political science. I'll be fine.

352
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,860
是啊 好事都会干上你的
Yeah, a lot of good that's gonna do you.

353
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,400
Tom James刚才对匹兹堡的凶手表示了同情
Tom James just sympathized with that Pittsburgh shooter

354
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,730
这么一来 他的政治脑袋被打开了花
and in doing so has blown his political brains out.

355
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,950
是啊 他刚向所有有枪的傻X们
Yeah, he just made an enemy of every stupid person

356
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,200
树了个敌 那种人可不少
with a gun, and there are a lot of those.

357
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,490
如果我们什么都不做
If we don't do something about this,

358
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,460
我们的枪支和安保客户就会开始疑惑
our gun and security clients are gonna start to wonder

359
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,410
他们到底为什么要付这么多钱给我们
why it is the hell they pay us so much money,

360
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,330
这可不好  因为我需要他们付我钱
which is bad because I need them to pay me

361
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,630
而不是试图在我睡觉时枪杀我
and not try and shoot me in my sleep.

362
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,910
看看这个混蛋 他已经盯上我了
Look at this asshole. He's already got me in his sights.

363
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,170
- 你好 混蛋 - 好吧 我们可以让他上镜
- Hi, asshole. - Okay, well, we just put him on camera

364
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:20,000
批评Tom James同情杀人犯
and he can criticize Tom James for sympathizing with murderers.

365
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:22,310
让我们无需参与任何无益的枪支辩论
Stops us from being involved in any unhealthy gun debate.

366
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,150
干得漂亮 你可能是
Very well done. You might

367
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,470
我给过钱的女人里最聪明的了
be the smartest woman I've ever paid for.

368
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:27,010
你知道吗? 我来办 已经搞定了
You know what? I'm on this. Already done it.

369
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,010
老天 我真的非常
Oh, man, I'm really

370
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:30,310
享受你们兄妹之间的这种竞争
enjoying this sibling rivalry between you two.

371
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,820
我在想那你对于我们来说是什么
I'm trying to figure out what that makes you to us.

372
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,020
- 爸爸 - 啊
- Daddy. - Ah.

373
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,520
我一会儿打给你
I've got to call you back.

374
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:39,020
我在那儿快死了 这超出了我的控制
I was dying out there. It was out of my control.

375
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:40,940
所以真的有什么情况在你的控制之中吗?
So there are situations within your control?

376
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,280
好吧 Tom James不顾后果我行我素
All right, Tom James is a loose cannon

377
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:46,530
这看起来像是我在最后一刻选择了他
and it looks like I chose him at the last minute,

378
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,080
当然事实确实如此 但是民众不能知道这一点
which I did, obviously, but people can't know that.

379
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,750
我不是梅林(魔法师) 好吗?
Well, I am not Merlin, okay?

380
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,750
我没有魔法汽车 或者其他法师有的什么东西
I don't have a magic car or whatever he had.

381
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:55,960
我不能把一个支持疯子的疯子包装得漂亮
I can't tie a ribbon around a crazy guy who supports crazy guys.

382
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,460
如果我们需要 你必须把猫王下垂腐烂的阴囊
You'll tie a ribbon around Elvis's sagging, rotten ball sack

383
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,430
打扮得漂亮 Mike
if we ask you to, Mike.

384
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,680
这就是你的工作
That's your job.

385
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,050
我只是说 不要为了这件事
I'm just saying don't rake me over the coals

386
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,180
吼我 好吗?
for this one, okay?

387
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,470
Tom James在美国各地拉屎
Tom James took a crap all over America.

388
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,220
为什么要我铲屎? 我又不是掏粪工
Why do I got to grab the shovel? I'm not a shit cleaner.

389
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,640
这是你的工作 你就是铲屎官
It's your job. You are the shit shoveler.

390
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,470
你就是干这个的
That's what you do.

391
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,140
- 铲屎官 - 有些屎铲不掉
- Shit shoveler. - Well, some shit doesn't get off.

392
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,560
- 什么? - 我不知道那是什么意思
- What? - I don't know what that means.

393
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,480
还有为什么突然之间大家称我的
And why is everybody calling my Families First Bill

394
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,480
家庭第一提案为Meyer妈咪提案?
the Mommy Meyer Bill all of a sudden?

395
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,990
你告诉我把你的名字和提案联系在一起
You told me to connect your name to the bill.

396
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,710
你现在这是什么语气?
What is the tone that you're using right now?

397
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,830
今天很糟糕 女士 我很抱歉
It's been a shitty day, ma'am, I apologize.

398
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,710
- 啊哈 - 您让我将其称为Meyer提案
- Uh-huh. - You asked me to call it the Meyer Bill.

399
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,050
啊哈
Uh-huh.

400
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,970
媒体最近发现把它称为
The press has recently found it amusing

401
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,800
妈咪Meyer提案很搞笑
to call it the Mommy Meyer Bill.

402
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,890
好吧 杀了妈咪 好吗?
Well, kill the Mommy, okay?

403
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,670
因为它在毒害我的提案
'Cause it's making my bill toxic.

404
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,560
就好像把脑癌这个词
It's like they took the word brain tumor

405
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,390
变成Selina囊肿一样
and changed it to Selina Cyst.

406
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,180
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

407
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,180
请允许我读一个简短的声明
if I may, I'd like to read a short statement.

408
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,150
事实上 不 我...
Actually, no, I'm...

409
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,990
不 我不准备读这个
No, I'm not going to read this.

410
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:01,650
我要发自内心地说点什么
I'm gonna speak from the heart.

411
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,270
他要自由发挥了 老天 真他妈太有黑道大佬范儿了
He's going freestyle. God, that is so   fucking gangster.

412
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,280
我爸爸总是告诉我
My dad always used to say to me,

413
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,320
"如果你做了错事
"If you do something wrong,

414
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,080
你必须立刻纠正错误"
you've got to try to make it right immediately."

415
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,420
我说什么都无法帮助
Well, there's nothing I can say that's gonna help

416
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,330
受害者的亲人们
the loved ones of those victims.

417
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:17,420
但是我可以也将要说我...
But I can say and I will say that I am...

418
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:22,210
如果我让他们更加悲痛
I am truly, truly sorry

419
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,880
我真的真的很抱歉
if I have added to their grief.

420
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:27,760
谢谢大家
Thank you.

421
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,880
我不能说感觉很好
Well, I can't say that that felt good,

422
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:35,470
因为明显感觉糟透了 但同时也感觉很好
because obviously it felt terrible, but it also felt good.

423
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,020
干得漂亮 失陪
It played great. Excuse me.

424
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,110
- 好的 - 先生 太棒了和好神奇生的孩子
- Yeah. - Sir, awesome and amazing had a baby

最后肯定会有些事与愿违 显然的

583
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,940
他们总会加上很多修正法案

我们有最棒的金融精英在处理那些法条

00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,000
听着 我不会把我的想法搞得人尽皆知的
Listen, I'm not gonna tell everyone what I think.

604
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,000
老天 我在洗手间里待不过十秒
Jeez, I wouldn't last 10 seconds in a men's room.

605
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:08,090
但私下和你们说 我认为诚实才是上策

看起来这个聚会被戳到静默点了
Seems like the party has hit a quiet point.

620

这其实没有听上去那么恶劣

"如果这只手会说话 它肯定会说'快给我洗洗吧'"
"If this hand could talk, it would say 'wash me.'"

656

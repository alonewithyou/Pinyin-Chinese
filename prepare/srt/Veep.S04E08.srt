00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,470
- 嘿 Gary 最近咋样? - 这不是你...你的...
- Hey, Gary. How you doing? - Good, good. - So, He's not--oing? - This isn'tou Go.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,760
- 他是我侄子 - 真可爱 我觉着
- He's my nephew. - Cute, I imagine.

3
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,390
跟你这么说吧 小孩 这里是张毛爷爷
I'll tell you what, kid. Here's a Jackson.

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:20,230
给你自己买十罐汽水 然后你从没见过我们
Go get yourself 10 sodas and you never saw us.

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,980
或者就是水 就买水吧
Or just water. Just choose water.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,320
- 哇 这真奇怪不是么? - 嗯
- Wow, this is weird, huh? - Mm.

7
00:00:26,350 --> 00:00:29,110
我已经好久没见到你们俩了 哇
It's been a long time since I've seen you guys. Wow.

8
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,610
你看到我发你的那些图片了吗?
Did you see those pictures that I sent you?

9
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,860
并没有 Gary 还有我们他妈的为啥要来这儿?
No I didn't Gary. And why the fuck are we here?

10
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,030
好吧 别激动别激动 这里不留名字的
Okay, easy, easy. It's anonymous.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,700
就装作你们是父母来参观这个地方的吧
Just pretend like you're parents checking this place out.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,700
- 画点什么吧 - 我甚至都不画自己的指甲 Gary
- Paint something. - I don't even paint my own nails, Gary.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,370
一个越南女士来给我画的
A Vietnamese lady does that.

14
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,950
快说 不然我们就走了
Talk or we leave.

15
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,120
是关于家庭第一提案的
It's the Families First Bill.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,010
对于总统来说这段时间很难过
It's a difficult time for the president.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,880
Gary 我很擅长我的工作
Gary, I am very good at my job,

18
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,540
然而甚至连我都不能
And even I can't get

19
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,050
让民众投票给那个添油加醋不知何物的东西
People to vote for that heap of mystery meat.

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,130
不是这样的 恰恰相反 她想让这个法案消失掉
It's not that. It's the opposite. She wants it to go away.

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,220
所以Selina需要失去选票
So Selina needs to lose the vote

22
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,640
而你想让我们抓住最后的机会游说国会议员
And you want us to lobby members of Congress under the wire.

23
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,310
我真高兴我离开了 她已经完全变成女版Colonel Kurtz了
I am so glad I left. She has gone full Colonel Kurtz.

24
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:03,310
Colonel Kurtz:小说Heart of Darkness中一个擅长心理控制的角色

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,230
她是不是在桌子下面下命令?
Is she giving orders from under the desk?

26
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,390
她根本不知道这件事 好吗?
She doesn't even know about this, all right?

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,110
而且她不能知道这件事
And she's not gonna know about this.

28
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,730
啊 既然这样 那我就要对此表示同意
Okay, well, in that case, I'm gonna say yes to this,

29
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,780
- 但是仅仅为了一个原因 - 忠诚?
- but for one reason only. - Loyalty?

30
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,950
- 钱 - 你就不能为了Selina做这件事吗?
- Money. - Can't you just do this for Selina?

31
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,740
- 不行 - 哦 好吧 但是我无权答应这个啊
- No. - Okay, well, I can't authorize that.

32
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,160
好吧 那让Ben来
Well, get Ben to.

33
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,710
你怎么知道Ben也被扯进来了?
How'd you know Ben was involved?

34
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,330
- 真行 - 因为他没被扯进来
- Okay. - Because he's not.

35
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:28,160
- 对哦 - 这已经完全失去控制了
- Right. - This is getting completely out of hand.

36
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,420
不 不 没有
No, no, it isn't.

37
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,500
我们刚接受了你的请求
We just accepted your proposal

38
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,500
我们会和大人物保持交流的
And we'll be in touch with the figures.

39
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:34,840
噢 好吧 谢谢
Okay, all right. Thank you.

40
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:37,510
喂喂喂别 你想暴露我们的身份吗
No, no, no. You want to blow our cover?

41
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,560
没人在手工店里握手
Nobody shakes hands in a craft shop.

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,760
你要知道 这里起码有三个小孩是我的
You know, at least three of these kids are probably mine.

43
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,760
好吧
Okay.

44
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,450
今天对于Meyer总统来说是个大日子
A big day for President Meyer

45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,780
因为她被围攻的家庭第一提案
As her beleaguered Families First Bill

46
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,700
终于到了最终投票阶段
Faces the final vote.

47
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,250
- 你在干啥呢? - 啥?
- What are you doing? - What?

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,620
为什么把花摆在在这个的前面?
Why are the flowers in front of it?

49
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,670
如果花在那儿的话我看不到了好伐
I can't see it if the flowers are there.

50
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,870
- 哦上帝 - 哦天哪
- Ugh, God. - Oh, God.

51
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,380
哦别 别 让我去拿 你个可爱的病号
No, no, let me get that, you sweet little invalid.

52
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,290
我不是病号 我完完全全好着呢
I'm not an invalid. I'm completely fine.

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,180
- 这些是空的 - 我都不知道我怎么感冒的
- These are empty. - I don't know how I got this.

54
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,880
大概是见了太多人了吧 我猜
From meeting people, I guess.

55
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,390
上帝 Gary 我真希望耶稣
God, Gary, I wish to Jesus

56
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,800
让你得流感而不是我
That you had gotten this flu instead of me.

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,300
哦上帝啊 我也这么觉得 我也是
Oh, my God, me, too. Me, too.

58
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,940
好啦 让我们开始吧
All right, here we go.

59
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:26,310
- 就放在那儿 - 哇哇哇哇
- Put it right there. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

60
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,940
她需要睡个小觉 她就睡个小觉
She needs to nap. She needs to nap.

61
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,940
并且这是一个Gary Walsh执行命令
And that is a Gary Walsh executive order.

62
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,480
- 记着了 - Gary 我好的天花乱坠 好吗?
- Duly noted. - Gary, I'm completely fine, okay?

63
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,060
我今天就在家工作了 哦上帝啊
I'm just working from home today. My God.

64
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,650
好样的 海湾干净了
Okay, coast is clear.

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,650
211个人会反对这项法案
211 are voting against the bill.

66
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,990
五个未决定 然后我们正在试图把三个支持的

67
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,540
转换为反对的那一派
That we're working on turning around into nos.

68
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,130
所以不通过是在我们意料之中的
So defeat is within our grasp.

69
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,410
- 女士 - 嗯?
-Ma'am. - Yes?

70
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,500
这个iPad上有我喜欢的一个语音备忘录应用

铺砖游戏 如果你想玩的话

73
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:57,390
- 啥?铺砖? - 当然 你不想玩的
- A what? A tile? - Which, of course, you don't want to play.

74
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,010
那是家庭第一提案么?
Is that Families First?

75
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,090
是的 很快要投票了 但是我们正在努力让它不通过
Yeah, it's really close, but we're doing our best to lose it.

76
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,890
我能表示一下知道这玩意让我的工作多困难吗?

而且我的工作已经很困难了
Which is already extremely difficult.

78
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,360
我们不得不让这个法案不通过
We have to lose the vote

这样才有一丝机会来赢得竞选

80
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,770
我们砍掉这个法案 然后让舆论停止

81
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,020
我可是媒体主管

Cazzelli, Lennox 还有那些蠢货 Jonah Richard

并且有时候一个伟大的人才能见到其伟大之处

99

喝醉了然后在脚底贴上蜡笔么?
Get drunk and tape crayons to their feet?

104
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,070
嗯 如果我告诉你那点已经取消了呢?
Well, what if I told you that was gone?

105
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,540
但是这没取消不是吗?
But it isn't gone, is it?

How about a little bit of consideration for a dying woman?

You colossal fucking fanny pack. You don't get it, do you?

-哦 这是你的车吧? -是的
- Oh, this is your car, right? - Yep.

142
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,560
看吧 弄好了
See? Fixed it.

143
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,890
好的
Okay.

144
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,850
你居然还倒车? 赶紧向前开啊
You're backing up? Just fucking go straight.

145
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,470
我上过精准驾驶课
I took a precision driving class,

146
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:04,180
Dan 我知道我在做什么
Dan. I think I know what I'm doing.

147
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,600
女士 没能联系上Pierce 抱歉
Ma'am, we've lost Pierce. I'm sorry.

148
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,880
我们应该派海豹突击队去
We should have hired Navy SEALs

149
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:09,860
而不是那两个人型笨海豹
instead of those two actual seals.

150
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,520
你们怎么能把一个大活人弄丢的?
How do you lose a whole person?

151
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,990
丢一个袖扣我能理解 人怎么能弄丢?
A cuff link I get, but not a person.

152
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,610
好的
Okay.

153
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,450
她说她说不出话来了
She said she's losing her voice.

154
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,700
刚听一个记者说
Just heard from a reporter who says Moyes

155
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:23,910
Moyes认为白宫
thinks the White House

156
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,750
雇了说客去搅黄自己的法案
hired lobbyists to destroy its own bill.

157
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:28,840
-哦 天啊 -老天
- Oh, my God. - Jesus.

158
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,210
好的 好的
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

159
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:35,600
她说你搞砸了 Ben
She said you fucked up, Ben.

160
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:37,880
你把Gary拉进这摊浑水我极其生气 你得把他安全的弄出去
And I'm mad as hell that you put Gary in the shit. You need to get him out.

161
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,100
-她没这样说 Gary -是的 她说了
- She didn't say that, Gary. - Yes, she did.

162
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,610
所有人都把臭嘴给我闭上！
Everyone, shut your fucking holes!

163
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,200
总统没有生病
The president is not sick.

164
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:54,530
有病的是你们 你们这些寄生虫
You guys are. You're parasites.

165
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,400
你们简直就是一群庸人式侵袭
You're like an infestation of mediocrity.

166
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,620
我才不在乎你是否是一个五十年代的电台广播员
I don't care if you're a 1950s radio broadcaster.

167
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,910
你是否是一个被撕烂
You're Fozzie Bear who's been ripped up

168
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,380
还曾走私过海洛因的福滋熊
and used to smuggle heroin.

169
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,380
一只喜欢说笑话的布偶熊

170
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,910
还有你 纳粹医生 而你 我他妈根本就不知道你是个什么鬼
A Nazi doctor. I don't even know what the fuck you are.

171
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,470
这与你们自己的利益无关
This is not about serving yourselves.

172
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,720
而是要为总统效力
This is about serving the president.

173
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,420
所以我们好好效力 行吗？
So let's do that, shall we?

174
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,890
-Tom -Tom
- Tom. - Tom.

175
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,420
-闭嘴 Gary -闭… 好的
- Shut up, Gary. - Shut... mm-hmm.

176
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,090
领导训话这种事得我来做 好吗?
?
do the team talks, okay?

177
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,430
您说得很对 女士
You're absolutely right, ma'am.

178
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:23,310
我赞成你刚才说的所有话
And I agree with everything you just said.

179
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,150
振作起来好吗 同志们！
So get it together, people!

180
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,570
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

181
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,770
找到Pierce
Find Pierce.

182
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,770
打电话给航空航天局
Call NASA.

183
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,520
他们的卫星
They've got to have a satellite

184
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,860
肯定能定位出一个脑残
that can pinpoint a moron.

185
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,440
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

186
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,640
如果你想抓住一个逃犯
If you want to catch a fugitive,

187
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,830
你就得站在逃犯的角度思考
You got to think like a fugitive.

188
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,700
-他会去哪？ -呃 机场
- Where's he going? - Uh, to the airport.

189
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,950
他为什么要去机场？
Why would he be going to the airport?

190
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,120
去赶飞机啊 Dan
To catch a plane, Dan.

191
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,950
你知道吗 你可以多踩两下油门的 Jonah
You know, you could just hit the fucking gas, Jonah.

192
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Dan 我可不想被开罚单
Dan, I'm not getting a ticket.

193
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,310
这种事在以后竞选时
That's the kind of shit that

194
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,460
会给我带来麻烦的
comes back to bite you when you run for office.

195
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,340
是啊 那种事才会耽误你
Yeah, that's what's gonna hold you back.

196
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,800
好吧 车里的新规则 如果你的名字是D打头
Okay, new rule in the Cube. If your name begins with D,

197
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:59,130
你就得立即给我闭嘴
you need to shut the fuck up immediately.

198
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,130
没我什么事 因为我的名字开头是R
I'm fine because my name begins with an R.

199
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,640
-叫你的简称“混蛋”就有你的事了（Dick有混蛋的意思 也是Richard的简称） -好吧
- Not if we shorten it to Dick. - Well, I mean...

200
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,890
-哦 那个好像是Amy -在哪?
- Oh, I think that's Amy. - Where?

201
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,860
我的天 我他妈在后座都看见了
Jesus Christ, I'm in the back seat and I can fucking see her.

202
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,810
哦 在那儿呢 好的
Oh, right there. Okay, fine.

203
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,150
-议员先生 -哦 哇哦
- Congressman. - Oh, wow.

204
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,980
这可有点吓人啊 听着 我不是在躲你们 希望你能明白
Well, this is freaky. Look, I'm not hiding, just so you know.

205
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,870
好的 议员先生 是时候离开礼品店了
Okay, Congressman, time to exit through the gift shop.

206
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,950
好的 先生 你得跟我们走
Okay, sir, you're gonna have to come with us.

207
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:22,820
伙计们 我母亲现在病太严重了 我不能丢下她一个人
Guys, my mom is too ill to be left alone right now.

208
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,990
我是说 我现在丢下她一个人
I mean, I left her alone right now

209
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,710
是因为她喜欢看书
Because she likes to read.

210
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:30,250
当然她现在看不了 因为她病的很重
But she can't read right now because she's very sick.

211
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,170
可能会好转吧 也可能更糟
But she might get better. Or she might not get better.

212
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,920
- 有书陪葬她就安心了 - 她还没到奄奄一息的地步吧
- She could be buried with a book. - We know she's not dying.

213
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,720
- 她还在和病魔苦苦斗争 这是重点 - 她真棒
- She's a fighter, is the thing. - Good for her.

214
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,390
虽然再次说出这话有点诡异
As weird as it feels to still be saying this,

215
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,510
但总统希望你去白宫一趟
The president would like to see you at the White House.

216
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,820
我觉得我要重蹈覆辙 殒命于此了
I feel like I'm about to kick it old school and die in office.

217
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,440
巅峰之时却选择了放弃
Quitting on a high.

218
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,690
你觉得我这么做对吗?
Do you think I'm doing the right thing here?

219
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,860
我是说 这提案其实挺好的
I mean, this is a good bill.

220
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,620
尽管有些水分 但对民众的生活
Even watered down, I think it's gonna make a difference

221
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:08,700
是有所改善的
In people's lives.

222
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,920
您才是总统
Ma'am, you're the president.

223
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,290
轮不到我来告诉您该怎么做
It's not for me to tell you what to do.

224
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,090
对哦
Yeah.

225
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,540
估计还是否决了它比较好
Guess I should kill it.

226
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,710
没错
Is the right answer.

227
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,970
我冷
I'm cold.

228
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,600
这里有华氏110度(43摄氏度左右)了吧
It's actually about 110 in here.

229
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,810
一点也不暖和
There's no way it's warm in here.

230
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,390
- 你真觉得热? - 这里暖和得都可以种西红柿了
- Do you really feel warm? - You could grow tomatoes in here.

231
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,530
真的 无比的热
Honestly, it is unbelievable.

232
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,140
好吧 我可不能为了你而降温
Well, I can't make it cooler for you.

233
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,980
功劳是我们的
Well, we're taking the credit.

234
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:39,400
不 是我们的
No, we're taking the credit.

235
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,070
要不折中一下? 功劳全是我们的
How about a compromise? We'll take all the credit.

236
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,040
- 好吧 也许我们可以平分赏金? - 什么赏金?
- Well, perhaps we could split the bounty? - What bounty?

237
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,900
哼 我估计赏金是没有的 不过--
Well, I'm guessing there's no bounty, but--

238
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,990
Dan Amy 近来如何? 剩下的交给我吧
Dan, Amy, how are you? I'll take it from here.

239
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,080
- 我想带Pierce一起进去 - 哎 哎 不行 不行
- I want to take in Pierce. - Whoa, whoa. No, no, no.

240
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,020
我们不能为了这家伙
We are not going into the

241
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,790
进白宫暴露自己
White House and blowing our cover for this guy.

242
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,080
你不能进来 这是总统的命令
You can't come in. That comes from the president.

243
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,130
- 是吗 她这个婊砸 - 我会转告她你问好了的
- Well, she's a bitch. - I'll tell her you said hi.

244
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,050
嘿 我们得快点了
Hey, we got to get moving.

245
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,550
嗨 伙计们 好久不见
Hey, you guys. Long time no see.

246
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,220
不是吧 Mike 你也参与进来了?
Jesus, Mike, they got you involved in this?

247
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,420
你他妈的不是新闻发言人吗?
You're the fucking press secretary.

248
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,590
就是说啊 我也没想明白呐
Thank you. That's what I've been saying.

249
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,310
我也不想被卷进来的好不
I have no wish to be embroiled in this either.

250
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,760
这跟我的推诿本领可不搭
It doesn't sit well with my policy of plausible deniability.

251
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,480
快走吧 回见了
Let's get going. I'll see you around.

252
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,480
潜台词是 麻烦离我远点
And by that I mean please, stay away from me.

253
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,680
回见 阴魂不散的跟班们
See you later, ghosts of staffers past.

254
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,770
总统女士 我把议员Pierce带来了

总统想请你帮个忙
The president needs you to do something for her.

大使? 我吗?
Ambassador? Me?

266
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,640
噢 哇哦 和我想象的不太一样啊
Oh, wow. Not what I was expecting.

J'adore Paris. I've never been, but it looks amazing.

273
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,540

286
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,980
虽然不知道你们在说什么 但是好的
- Don't get it, but it's all right.

287
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,520
我只是想帮上忙
I just want to help.

288
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,350
不过 记得告诉我 我会被派去哪里就好了
But, yeah, just let me know where I'm going.

289
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:47,530
- 你现在就想知道? - 对 这样最好
- You need to know now? - Yeah, that would be great.

290
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:51,080
您觉得呢 女士?
What'd you say, ma'am?

291
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,620

Mm-hmm.

292
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,290
- 她说不了话 - 嗯
- Her voice is gone. - Yeah.

293
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,090
她能说出我要去的地方吗?
Was she able to say where I'm going?

294
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,510
我就职的地方?

295
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,140
啊哈 嗯哼
Uh-huh. Mm-hmm.

296
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,970
嗯
Mm-hmm.

297
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,310
你可以去巴黎
You can have Paris.

298
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,860
什么? 我能去巴黎?
- What? - I can have Paris?

299
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:24,400
- 哇哦 谢谢 - 不 不 不用

300

No, no. I mean, yes, I'm voting no.

304
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,240
刚刚睡着了
It's an "Otter."

305
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,660
没事 女士 Pierce答应投否决票了
No, ma'am, Pierce went to vote.

306
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,960
他还觉得自己会去巴黎
And then he thinks he's off to Paris.

307
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,630
我说- 我说了巴黎不行
I said-- I said no to Paris.

308
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,800
我们会在投票后给他打电话 告诉他是去摩加迪沙
We'll call him after the vote, tell him it's Mogadishu.

309
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,890
他刚刚可以随便乱说
He literally could have said anything.

310
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,760
刚才那一瞬间 Gary成了世上最有权势的人
For a moment, Gary was the most powerful person in the world.

311
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,430
听起来挺有趣 给我弄点汤来
That's hilarious. Get me some soup.

312
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,140
好
Yep.

313
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,340
问题是 众议院会通过本次修订法案吗?
The question is, will the House pass the bill as amended?

314
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,000
-此次投票限时十五分钟
- This is a 15-minute vote.

315
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,540
老天爷啊 屁股打那一针真是要了命了
Oh, my God. My ass is killing me from that shot.

316
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,710
但我感觉身体好多了
But I feel pretty good.

317
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,630
真的?
Really?

318
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,050
总统夫人 - 怎么了?
Ma'am. - What?

319
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,130
天呐 开始了
Oh, boy. Here we go.

320
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,390
这感觉就像我希望自己的孩子能顺利的生下来
It's like I want my baby to live.

321
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,140
我不想自己的孩子胎死腹中
I don't want my baby to die.

322
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:24,220
我们还是就把它看做一条法案吧
Maybe think of it more of as a bill,

323
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,020
这个比喻最真实的贴近了法案
which in a very real way is what it is.

324
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,610
- 恩 - 到Pierce了
- Mm. - There's Pierce.

325
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,450
他连走路都那么呆
He even walks dumb.

326
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,950
每次我看到他 都仿佛能听到马戏团的音乐声
Every time I see him, I hear circus music.

327
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:36,370
要给力啊Owen 这是你发光发亮的时刻
Come on, Owen. It's your time to shine,

328
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,290
你倒霉催的破灯泡
you dim fucking bulb.

329
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,740
- 他投了否决票 提案没通过 -哦!
- He voted no. We lost the vote. - Oh!

330
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:42,570
我们成功地失败了
We are victorious in defeat.

331
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:45,380
我们可以短暂地兴奋一下
We may allow ourselves a brief period of rejoicing.

332
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:47,660
好吧 我的提案被否了
Okay, so I lost the vote.

333
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,550
我输了提案 但却赢了这一场
I won by not winning.

334
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,630
天啊 我真是百感交集
God, I don't know how I feel.

335
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:55,920
且不说 我现在感觉像一只浣熊在我脑袋里拉了坨屎
Apart from, like, having a raccoon take a shit in my head.

336
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,090
您应该感觉棒棒哒 夫人
You should feel great, ma'am.

337
00:24:57,090 --> 00:24:59,390
这是一场实实在在的 至关重要的胜利
That was a solid, important defeat.

338
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,890
- 我要先去把衣服换了...
- I'm gonna go change my clothes... -

339
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:05,260
...跟全国观众发几句牢骚 然后再回到床上歇着去
...croak to the nation, and then I'm going back to bed.

340
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,150
这样不错
This is good.

341
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,600
Moyes威胁要去议会
Moyes is threatening to go to the floor

342
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,070
要求给今天发生的一切来个官方彻查
for an official investigation into what happened today.

343
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,770
- 糟糕透了 -嗯哼
- This is bad. - Mm-hmm.

344
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,410
我也是其中的一份子 那是不是意味着我也受到牵连了?
I'm in the middle of this. Does this mean I'm implicated, too?

345
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,940
这样吧 就算是也跟我说不是
You know what. Just say no even if it does.

346
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,780
Gary 你说过你是重要的一环 这我可以证明
Well, Gary, you said you were important. I can testify to that.

347
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:23,000
Ben 既然这是你说过的
Ben, this is one of those

348
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,450
那些小波折是不会发生的
little hiccups that you said was not gonna happen,

349
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,670
那我就把这事留给如此能干的你了
so I'm gonna leave this in your capable hands.

350
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,200
Mike 你要像从未
Mike, you have to deny

351
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:33,340
撒过谎一样 去否认这件事
this like you've never denied anything before.

352
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,760
就是撒谎咯? 我一直以来避免去做的事?
So lie? The one thing I've been trying not to do?

353
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,470
听着 我不会让你做连我自己都做不到的事
Look, I wouldn't ask you to do anything I wouldn't do myself.

354
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,800
其实刚才这句话是假的 你习惯习惯吧
nd while that isn't true, find some comfort in it.

355
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:48,470
好了 Gary -别找我!
Okay, Gary? - Nope.

356
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,200
在不久的将来 我会在国会之前
I will work on putting forward a new, streamlined

357
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:58,700
送上一份新的且更为完善的Families First Bill
Families First Bill before Congress in the near future.

358
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:01,450
她的声音像是Bob Dylan在水下唱歌
She sounds like an underwater Bob Dylan.

359
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:05,120
很难听懂她正在说什么
It is actually quite difficult to understand what she's saying.

360
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:07,990
...即将面临灾难性气候的孩子们
...children from impending climate Armageddon.

361
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:11,160
这没准儿是个好事
Which may be a good thing.

362
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,830
天佑美利坚
And God bless America.

363

所以如果我能提供各种网页设计或者支持...
So if I can offer any web design or support...

427
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,780
先生 我们能问你今晚会怎么投票吗?
Sir, can I ask you how you're going to vote today?

428
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,280
- 不能 - 不能是在说我们不能问你还是说你--
- No. - Is that no as in I can't ask you or no as in--

429
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,920
嘿 Sue 你见到我的包了吗
Hey, Sue, have you seen my bag?

430
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,620
哇哇哇 这里发生什么事了
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

431
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,290
这里是我的地盘 她需要静养 出什么事了?
This is my area. She needs quiet. What's going on?

432
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,870
把这个放在角落里就好 谢谢
Put it right there in the corner. Thank you.

433
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,710
不不不 你不能这样做 不能这样
No, no, no. You can't do this. You cannot do this.

434
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,960
Sue 我需要你在我房间外面
Sue, I need you to set up an office

435
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,460
设立一个办公室
outside the bedroom.

436
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,590
好的
Okay.

437
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,510
你不是唯一一个重要的人 Sue
You're not the only one who's important, Sue.

438
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:06,470
Gary
Gary.

439
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,220
能给我带杯加柠檬跟蜂蜜的热水吗?
Can I have a hot water with lemon and honey?

440
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,800
看到没?
See?

441
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,470
你应该去拿水了 Gary
You should get on that, Gary.

442
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,860
啊 我知道
Uh, I know.

443
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,860
所以 Tom 你对我们总统感觉如何?
So, Tom, how are you finding our president?

444
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,650
呃 你知道 像总统一样的
Oh, you know, presidential.

445
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,650
感觉像是她要管理整个国家似的
It's like she wants to run the whole damn country.

446
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,370
你知道吗? 之前那货 他也是这样的
You know what? The last guy, he was the same way.

447
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,710
我们同意她要继续当总统
We agreed she's gonna stay president.

448
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,040
我们必须得做一切来停止这个法案
We have to do everything we can to stop that bill.

449
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,910
所以你会么?
So are you?

450
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,830
你要知道 这句话开始说的是“我们”
You know, you just started that last sentence with a "We"

451
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,500
然后你以“你”来结束了这句子
And you finished it with a "You."

452
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,830
你有什么进展么?
Are you making progress?

453
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,630
是 我在弄 我让Richard和Jonah--
Yeah, I'm on it. I got Richard and Jonah--

454
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:44,300
哦 Ben 我不需要知道你在干嘛
Ooh, Ben, I don't need to know what you're doing.

455
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,760
我只需要把这玩意搞定
I just need to get it done.

456
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,510
超级 超级大的撕逼 连新郎都被卷进去了
Huge, huge fight. Even the bride got involved.

457
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,140
- 不会吧 - 简直棒呆了
- No. - Amazing.

458
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,810
波士顿的婚礼就是这么帅气
There is nothing like a Boston wedding.

459
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,680
- 让我给你讲讲 - 哇 刚刚那简直是让我担忧的棒 Tom
- Let me tell you that. - Wow, that was worryingly good, Tom.

460
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,190
我是指 刚刚那可是柔道黑带级别的扯淡啊
I mean, that was some black belt jujitsu bullshit right there.

461
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,440
我得走了 我们需要在八分钟之内解决掉它
I have to go. We'll take this up in eight minutes' time.

462
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,780
- 你可以进去了 - 你不能进去
- You are clear to go in. - You can't go in there.

463
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,330
Kent 你可以直接进来
Kent, you can come straight in.

464
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,250
如果Gary试图阻止你 你可以无视他
If Gary tries to stop you, you can ignore him.

465
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,450
好吧 她发给我个备忘录说需要休息
Well, I have a memo saying that she needs rest.

466
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,040
- 你的是什么时候收到的? - 你的是什么时候收到的?
- When was yours sent? - When was yours sent?

467
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,250
我先问的
I asked you first.

468
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,590
我得看看我的手机
I'll have to check my phone.

469
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,360
女士 我知道这很难
Ma'am, I know it's

470
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,930
特别是当你在管理一个自由国家的时候
difficult when you're running the free world,

471
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,680
但是你真的需要去休息一下
But you should really get some rest.

472
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,460
是 或者我可以去换个新的医生
Yeah, ahem, or maybe I can get a new doctor.

473
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,020
既然这样 那我就建议您要一直喝水了 女士
In which case I'll just say keep taking the fluids, ma'am.

474
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:33,140
Moyes投反对票 好消息...
Moyes is voting no. Good news...

475
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,270
对于别人来说
For the other side.

476
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,190
- 这简直太糟糕了 - 是啊是啊
- That's so bad. - I know, I know.

477
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,060
- 太糟糕了 - 是的
- So bad. - Yeah.

478
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,610
你知道Moyes吗? 这简直太不可思议了
Have you heard about Moyes? It's incredible...

479
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,230
有些人的怎么这么目光短浅 难以置信
How shortsighted some people can be. Unbelievable.

480
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,230
难以置信 我们就在说这个
Unbelievable, that's what we were saying.

481
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:48,070
- 我之后再来看你 女士 - 哦 谢谢
- I'll check back on you later, ma'am. - Okay, thank you.

482
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:50,240
啊咳
Ahem.

483
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,210
好 恭喜你女士 Moyes这事太棒了
Okay, congratulations, ma'am. So great about Moyes.

484
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,880
我们只需要四个反对票 你的法案就砍了
We're now only four votes away from killing your bill.

485
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,790
我感觉我像是泰坦尼克号的船长
I feel like I'm captain of the Titanic

486
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:00,250
然后那个冰山是我自己凿出来的
And I carved out the iceberg myself.

487
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,750
好的 女士 我觉得你需要睡一个修身养心的觉
Okay, ma'am, I think you need to take a little power nap.

488
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,780
- 你需要休息 好吗?
- You need to rest, okay?

489
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,130
- 是的 我觉得我也应该去睡会
- Yeah, I think maybe I'm gonna rest.

490
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:07,050
- 是的 就放松一下身体 - 对
- Yeah, just rest your body. - Yeah.

491
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,590
女士 你准备好参加下一个会议了吗?
Ma'am, are you ready for your next meeting?

492
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,890
- 国防部长到了 - 哦 那我就不睡了
- SecDef is here. - Okay, no.

493
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,730
没关系的 我可以在我死翘翘的时候长眠
It's okay. I can sleep when I'm dead

494
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,400
大概就在一个小时之后
In about an hour.

495
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,430
家庭第一提案简直就跟翔一样
There is nothing good to be said about Families First.

496
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,570
自从Herod之后就没有任何立法
Not since Herod has there been a piece of legislation

497
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,820
能这样摧毁中产阶级家庭了
So damaging to average families.

498
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,160
先生 如果你想帮助家庭的话 这不是你想要的提案
Sir, if you want to help working families, this is not it.

499
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,420
这就感觉像是用一对勺子
This is akin to carrying

500
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,250
给你做心脏手术差不多
out heart surgery with a pair of spoons.

501
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,530
我不需要被两匹游说马来骑着 还引导我说
I don't need to be ridden by you two lobby horses

502
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,120
这个提案是大肠中的排泄物
To know that this bill is a waste of bowel space.

503
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,120
- 啊 那太棒了 - 太好了
- Well, that's great. - Fantastic.

504
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,010
能在政治活动里见到一个
It is nice to meet somebody in politics

505
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,840
知道自己说什么的人来换换心情 可真是开心
Who knows what he's talking about for a change.

506
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,810
啊 议员
Yeah, Congressman, I'm

507
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,630
我就把这些数据留给你
Just gonna leave you now with some numbers.

508
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,880
顺便剧透一下 它们加起来还不对数
And spoiler alert, they do not add up.

509
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,600
这跟Jonah Ryan给我的文件夹一样
This is the same folder that Jonah Ryan had.

510
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,640
等下 你见到Jonah Ryan了?
Wait, you met with Jonah Ryan?

511
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,600
六英尺长的蜡像和他那个可亲可爱的男盆友?
Six-foot waxwork and his  boyfriend?

512
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,970
- 那应该是他了 - 所以你们不为白宫工作
- That would be him. - So you don't work for the White House,

513
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,370
除非这么说"婊砸" 或者其它类似的这种
Unless it's like "Bitch" Or something like that.

514
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,120
- 对不起 - 借过
- I'm sorry. - Excuse me.

515
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,870
感谢您为国效命
Thank you for your service.

516
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,370
刚才的会议怎么样 先生?
How was the meeting, sir?

517
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,380
非常有效率
Very productive.

518
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,020
这简直像政治卡通片里面一样
It's like something out of a political cartoon.

519
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,690
什么 你是说不好玩吗
What, you mean not funny?

520
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,940
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

521
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,440
Moyes是他妈怎么跑到两个名单上的?
How the hell did Moyes end up on two lists?

522
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,770
我说过了 Ben
I made it clear Ben

523
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:13,360
应该把他名单上的所有变动都给我过目的
should run all his list alterations past me.

524
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:16,530
才不是 我的名单才是总名单 你的不过是子名单
No, mine was the master list. Your list was a sub-list.

525
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,900
它是子名单 也就意味着它是详细的特殊情况名单
It was a sur-list, which means over-list.

526
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,980
- 哦 草泥马 - 你的耳屎能放倒一位总统
- Oh, fuck you. - Your earwax could bring down a president.

527
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,740
而我当时其实一点都不想见到Dan和Amy
And I didn't even want to see Dan and Amy.

528
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,570
可现在他们想要钱
And now they're expecting money.

529
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,210
- 我不知道会这样 - 钱? 什么钱?
- I didn't know that. - Money? Money?

530
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,080
Gary 我才是唯一能批钱的人
Gary, I said access only.

531
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,240
是 现在我们只能把活动专款拨出一部分来用
Yeah, now we're gonna have to divert funds

532
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:33,000
这已经构成金钱欺诈
From the campaign and that's fraud.

533
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:34,750
于是我们又得销毁证据
And then we're gonna have to destroy the evidence

534
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,750
结果就成了有预谋的欺诈
And that's conspiracy to commit fraud.

535
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,250
不对 有现金交易记录就会对我们非常他妈的不利
No, a cash trail is very fucking bad for us.

536
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,840
- 喔 - 嘿 先别急着走 当月猛男
- Oh. - Hey, hold on there, Hunk of the Month.

537
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,590
我要是玩完了 你也一样
If I'm going down, you're going down, too.

538
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,760
我不知道这是怎么回事
I don't know what this is about.

539
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:48,840
问得好 Dan和Amy
Good point. Dan and Amy.

540
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,020
他们要拿到的现金
They're getting paid cash

541
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,100
是从为砍掉这个提案的那部分 竞选活动筹款里来的
From the campaign fund to bring down the bill.

542
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:54,070
从这儿 你就已经跳进黄河洗不清了
There, you've been blooded.

543
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,400
所以加入流氓圈 握紧老二
So join the circle jerk. Grab a dick.

544
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,210
我挺希望自己能听清
Wish I could hear what you

545
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,600
你在这没完没了的钻孔的声里说了什么
Were saying over that incessant drilling sound.

546
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:01,410
你干嘛呢? 小声点! -
What are you doing? Shh! -

547
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,860
什么现金?
What cash?

548
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,000
Dan和Amy什么?
What Dan and Amy?

549
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,120
Ben要付钱给Dan和Amy 让他们去游说反对法案
Ben's paying Dan and Amy to lobby against the bill

550
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,120
现在留下了交易记录 我们都会被控告
And now there's a cash trail and we're all incriminated.

551
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,620
但你不会
But you're not.

552
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,290
哦 天啊 现在你也会了!
Oh, my God, now you are!

553
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,840
干得好
Well done.

554
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,930
现在我感觉真是好多了
Now I feel a lot better.

555
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,210
你之前知道这事吗 Tom?
Did you know, Tom?

556
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,460
夫人 我和您一样震惊
Ma'am, I am as shocked as you are.

557
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:26,630
既震惊 又失望 Ben
Shocked and disappointed, Ben.

558
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,470
夫人 Moyes会投票支持那个法案
Ma'am, Moyes is voting yes.

559
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Ruiz也是
Ruiz is voting yes.

560
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,690
现在还剩最后一票 我们需要Pirece议员
This comes down to one vote. We need Congressman Pierce.

561
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,480
我的未来就掌握在那个傻逼家养小精灵手上?
My future depends on that dumb fucking elf?

562
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,950
天惹-- 他人在哪?
Jeez-- where is he?

563
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,310
我为你能这么勇敢而感到骄傲
I'm so proud of how brave you've been.

564
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,820
我本来想找点洁肤液 但他们没有--
I was looking for some lotion, but they didn't--

565
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,650
你好 Pierce议员 Pierce夫人
Hello, Congressman Pierce, Mrs. Pierce.

566
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,680
我们从白宫来

总统需要你为它投票

572
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,670
总统? 她让你们来找我?
The president? The president sent you here to talk to me?

573
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,500
她在话语中提到了你的名字
She used sentences containing your name.

574
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,090
好的 我加入 呃 我是说 当然没问题
Okay, I'm in. I mean, yeah, absolutely.

575
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,220
- 太好了! - 妈 总统夫人需要我去--
- Fantastic! - Mom, the president needs me to--

576
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,810

为家庭第一提案投赞成票

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,350
这是总统的私人请求 所以...
It was a personal request from the president, so...

581
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,600
议员先生 现在 虽然我尊重您的决定

582
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,320
你知道这项法案的修正案会

对你的行政区造成不利影响吧

584
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:24,410
努力工作的家庭不会愿意出钱支持懒人的
Hardworking families don't want to support lazy ones.

585
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,690
而你的支持率将会缩得
And your support will shrink

586
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,610
比泡在十二月哈德逊河里的小弟弟还快
Faster than a penis in the December Hudson.

587
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,330
- 真的吗? - 你们这群吃屎的吹箫侠
- Really? - You shit-eating cocksuckers.

588
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,370
- 冷静 冷静 - 我很抱歉
- Whoa, whoa! - I'm sorry,

589
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,700
Pierce夫人 你怎么敢跑到这里
Mrs. Pierce. How dare you come in here

590
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:34,030
来试图强迫一个人投票
And try to strong-arm a person

591
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,040
他可是正在自己生病的母亲床边呢
When he's sitting at his sick mother's bedside?

592
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,170
这明明是你刚才做的事 傻逼
That's exactly what you just did, dumbass.

593
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,760
用不着你告诉我 我做还是没做什么事
Don't tell me what I did or did not just do.

594
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,040
能不能请你们把声音放小一点?
Could you guys please keep the noise down?

595
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,790
这层楼还有很多病重的人
There's a lot of really sick people on this floor.

596
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,290
对 的确 我现在就看到有两个人病得不轻
Yes, there are. I see two very sick people.

597
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,800
那两个
Those two.

598
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,100
好吧 夫人 我刚刚和Amy通过话了
All right, ma'am, I've just spoken to Amy.

599
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,720
她还有Dan正在医院 Pierce在那看望他的母亲
Her and Dan are with Pierce and his mom at the hospital.

600
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:53,720
- 但是路上堵车了 - 额滴神啊
- But there's been a holdup. - Oh, God.

601
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,890
她大概打算死也要刁难我
She's probably gonna die just to spite me.

602
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,390
那个坏婊子
That evil bitch.

603
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,690
Richard 和Jonah也在那边
And Richard and Jonah are there.

604
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,690
要我说都怪Kent还有Bill
And I blame Kent and Bill for that.

605
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,060
喔 真是作了一手好死啊
Well, this is a long glass of frozen strawberry fuckup.

606
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,700
嘿 听着 Ben 你得做点什么
Hey, listen, Ben, you've got to do something.

607
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,900
我可不想为D区囚犯里最壮的那个收保护费啊
I don't want to be a bagman for the toughest guy in D block.

608
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,740
- 好了 别说了 Gary - 好了 听着 把Pierce带到这儿
- All right, stop it, Gary. - Okay, look, get Pierce here.

609
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,990
懂了嘛? 现在马上
Okay? Right now.

610
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,570
现在我得掌控这个
I'm gonna take control of this situation

611
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,160
我什么都不知道的局势 对吧?
That I don't know anything about, right?

612
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:21,250
因为我看上去是唯一一个...
Because I am the only one who seems to be...

613
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
- 有能耐的
- Capable.

614
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,760
- 喔 天
- Oh, God.

615
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,390
有没有什么可能帮您止咳?
Is it possible to stop coughing?

616
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,060
没有!
No!

617
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,890
但有相同的数字统计 嗯 现在我倒有兴趣了
But you have the same numbers. Well, now I'm interested.

618
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,690
老子现在太他妈有兴趣了
Now I am deeply fucking interested.

619
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,200
我们和他们用一样的办公文件夹
We have the same Office Depot folder as they do.

620
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,870
给"华盛顿邮报"打电话 我嗅到了阴谋的味道
Call the "Washington Post." I smell conspiracy.

621
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,120
好的 可以 为啥这个人像猫王一样抖腿?
Okay, sure, so why is this one shaking like Elvis's leg?

622
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:13,700
你知道 我愈发感觉
You know, I'm starting to get the feeling

623
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,870
副总统想让自己的提案失败
That Meyer wants her own bill to fail.

624
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:20,460
我觉得我又想重新投回赞成票了
I think I've just reboarded the vote yes express.

625
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,880
Meyer是个代行职务的总统
Meyer is a stand-in president.

626
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,050
你不觉得是时候找一个更有资格的人了吗?
Don't you think it's time we have someone who is qualified?

627
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,200
总统之所以有资格成为总统
The president is qualified

628
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,970
因为她就是总统
To be president because she is president.

629
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,760
你们党派中有已经是总统的竞选人了吗?
Does your party have a candidate who is president?

630
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:35,260
我喜欢这个
I like that.

631
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,180
谢谢 女士 再次感谢您能参与进来
Thank you, ma'am. And again, thank you for joining us.

632
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,480
哦 不客气 谢谢 嗯
Oh, you're welcome. Thank you. Ahem.

633
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,980
我们需要讨论一下Tom要戴什么颜色的领带
We need to discuss the color of tie that Tom's gonna wear

634
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,190
不好意思 女士 你说什么? 我没
I'm sorry, ma'am. What was that? I didn't

635
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,440
哦 哦 我就是发一个备忘录
Oh, no, I was just sending a memo.

636
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,190
我不想一直打扰你们
I didn't want to keep interrupting all the time.

637
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,410
真是思虑周全 谢谢
That is very considerate. Thank you.

638
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,000
没有什么能够管理经营一个文明社会
This is no way to run a civilized society.

639
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,950
- 我相信 - 那是什么?
- I believe - what is that?

640
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,830
总统发来的备忘录
It's a memo from the president.

641
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:04,420
- 你继续 这无关紧要 - 这很重要 Ben
- Go ahead, it's not important. - It is important, Ben.

642
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,540
我发的每个备忘录都重要
Every memo I send is important.

643
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:09,010
发送备忘录 天惹
Send memo. Jesus.

644
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,460
我没收到任何备忘录
I'm not getting any memos.

645
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,790
- 哦 现在我收到了
- Oh, now I am.

646
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,930
继续 Tom
Go ahead, Tom.

647
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,630
好的
Okay.

648
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,100
好吧 参议员 重新回到我的
Well, Senator, to return to my

649
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,050
就算这样 你也必须得表现的强势点  懂吗？
And you've got to be aggressive, though, you know?

650
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,940
拿出点男子气概
Man up here a little bit.

651
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,220
- 强势点? - 是的
- Be aggressive? - Yeah.

652
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,390
我要开始真生气了 参议员
I'm starting to get really angry, Senator.

653
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,700
我愈发感觉
I'm starting to feel that

654
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,950
你没有认真听我说 参议员
You're not really listening to me, Senator.

655
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,900
而且我受够了你持续地打断我
And I'm getting sick of your constant interruptions.

656
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:38,150
什么鬼? Moyes投赞成票?
What the fuck? Moyes is voting yes?

657
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,160
Moyes应该投反对票 应该反对
Moyes was 100% no. Moyes was a no.

658
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:43,540
Ben Moyes本应该坚决投反对票的
Ben, Moyes was supposed to be 100% no.

659
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,910
就这样吧  我办了个辩论会 你赢了 假装反对
That's it. I'm throwing the debate. You win, pretend opponent.

660
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,690
等一下
Wait a second, Kent

661
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,250
Kent有一个Jonah和Richard名列其中的会见名单
had a list who Jonah and Richard were seeing

662
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,630
而你有一个Dan和Amy名列其中的会见名单？
And you had a list who Dan and Amy were seeing?

663
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:53,220
你没想过把两个名单对比一下吗?
Did you not think to compare the lists?

664
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,500
我还有一个名单而且把你列在首位 Gary
I have another list and you're right at the top of it, Gary,

665
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,140
所以别他妈质疑我的工作方法
So don't you dare try to question my fucking methods.

666
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,590
好吧 我在另一方面
Well, I on the other hand,

667
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,810
极度质疑你的狗屎方法
Do dare to question your fucking methods.

668
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:02,740
好吧 Kent和我
Well, Kent and I were

669
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,260
负责行动的不同部分
running different parts of the operation.

670
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,460
所以你的人
So your people are going

671
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,650
会和Jonah与Richard见相同的人?
To see the same people as Jonah and Richard?

672
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,570
一个 就一个相同的人
One. One of the same people.

673
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,400
哦 一个 所以一个就没问题
Oh, one. So one's okay.

674
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,940
我们可以向超级碗现场只投放一枚核武器
We just let off one nuke at the Super Bowl.

675
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,610
哦 所以你要微观干涉
Oh, so now you want to micromanage

676
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,940
一些和你压根不想管的事情
Something that you didn't even want to be involved in.

677
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,280
我没想干涉 但是你不觉得
I don't want to manage it, but don't you think

678
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:22,000
我们能找一个有能力的人来做吗?
We could maybe find someone competent who could?

679
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,450
好了 不管是什么 我不需要知道
Okay, whatever it is, I don't need to know.

680
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,500
我来告诉你出什么事了
I'll tell you what's going on.

681
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,450
Jonah早先去见了Moyes 然后Dan和Amy也去见了他
Jonah saw Moyes earlier today and Dan and Amy have, too.

682
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,790
现在Moyes已经知道我们的意图了
And now Moyes is onto us.

683
00:10:28,790 --> 00:10:30,170
你为啥告诉我?
Why did you just tell me that?

684
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,760
这对我来说更糟糕
This is so much worse for me.

685
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,790
我就是分配给Dan和Amy任务的那个一线特工
I was the field agent who gave Dan and Amy the mission.

686
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,800
我就是那信使 我可能要被射杀了
I was the messenger. I could be shot.

687
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,140
这和你无关 Gary
This isn't about you, Gary.

688
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,970
天惹 这里没有你任何鸟事
Jesus, nothing here is ever about you.

689
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,010
我什么也没听到
I didn't hear any of this

690
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,850
因为我耳鸣很严重
cause I have a really bad case of tinnitus

691
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:44,720
特别是在讨论道德层面有疑问的事情的时候
Especially when discussing morally dubious things.

692
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,390
所以像是一种选择性罪孽耳鸣症
So it's kind of like sinnitus.

693
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,270
但我还是会受到牵连 我是关键环节
But I'm implicated. I'm the linchpin.

694
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,230
- 我可能要去改造了! - 闭嘴!
- I could go to jail! - Shut up!

695
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,900
不 你闭嘴 你也闭嘴
No, you shut up. You shut up.

696
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,780
而我也会最先闭嘴
And I will also shut up first.

697
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,120
Sue! Sue 我要见总统
Sue! Sue, I need to see the president.

698
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,820
她在开参谋长联席会议 Gary 很重要的事吗？
She's in with the joint chiefs, Gary. Is it that important?

699
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:02,290
听着 Sue 我卷入了点麻烦
Listen, Sue, I'm involved with some stuff here.

700
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,210
那种能让你死翘翘的可怕麻烦
Scary stuff like take it to your grave kind of stuff.

701
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,300
就是那样 那就是我喜欢的
And that's the that's the way I like it.

702
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,250
好吧 呃 她五分钟之内出来 能等一下吗?
Okay, well, she'll be out in five. Can it wait?

703
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,000
恩 没问题 好的
Yeah, no problem. No problem.

704
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,580
如果他要是调查我们卧底的事情呢？
What if he checks our cover story?

705
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,340
例如 如果他询问议会?
Like, what if he informs Congress?

706
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,340
Dan 他就是个议员
Dan, he's a congressman.

707
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:21,670
国会议员永远不会言行一致
Congressmen never do anything they say they're gonna do.

708
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,430

709
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,400

I'm kind of having fun. I like having a cover story.

710
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,230
让我像查理的天使一样炫酷
Makes me feel like a Charlie's Angel.

711
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,150

God, it was a rush!

712
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,010

Yeah, but you're a control

713
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,440
可这事已经失控了
Freak and this whole thing is out of control,

714
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,600

was kind of an uptight bitch, but now I sort of miss her.

你知道 如果说我神经质 那你就得罪我了
You know, if I was uptight, I'd be offended by that.

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,200
其实 你确实得罪我了 你不该叫别人婊砸
In fact, I am offended. You shouldn't call people bitches.

You shouldn't do that anymore.

1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,250
METER主席声明

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,250
白宫是否用游说来阻止家庭第一提案?

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,340
你知道在第一家庭提案投票的那天
Did you know what was going on in your name

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,060
有些人以你的名义做了一些什么吗?
on the day of the Families First vote?

5
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,900
你是不是在用说客游说?
Were you using lobbyists?

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:15,190
我永远不会让这种事情发生
I would never, ever let that happen.

7
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,590
而且就算它发生了 当然绝对不可能发生
And if it had happened, which it absolutely did not,

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,900
我也一定会采取某种措施的
I would make sure that something was done about it.

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,320
非常极其的肯定
Absolutely damn sure.

10
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:23,190
所以这对于国会来说不算是个麻烦?
So this wasn't a matter for Congress?

11
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,040
嗯 我确定国会的各位
Well, I am certain that Congress,

12
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:26,350
还有我的反对者们 与其关注这件事
and my opponents for that matter,

13
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:28,090
不如用他们的时间做更好的事
have better things to do with their time,

14
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,650
比如好好处理一下政府的事宜
like getting down to the business of government.

15
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:33,890
然后再让我向美国人民重申一次
And let me repeat myself again and say to the American people

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,520
这些没有根据的指控不具有任何一点点的真实性
that there is not one ounce of truth to these allegations.

17
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,710
- 总统女士-- - 不具有
- Madam President-- - Not

18
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:41,780
任何一点点的真实性
one ounce of truth to these allegations.

19
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:43,800
非常感谢 今天就到这里
Thank you very much. That's all the time I have for today.

20
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:44,210
- 谢谢
- Thank you.

21
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,100
别碰我
Don't touch me.

22
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,520
你是否向上帝发誓
Do you solemnly swear

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,300
你尽其所知
that the testimony you're about to give is the truth,

24
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,410
所述之言纯属实言并且无任何隐瞒?
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

25
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,750
- 我发誓 - 是的 我发誓
- I do. - Yes, I do.

26
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,690
完全同意 是的 先生 我发誓
Absolutely. Yes, sir, I do.

27
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:13,140
Cafferty先生 请恕我直言
Mr. Cafferty, pardon me being blunt,

28
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,380
为什么家庭第一提案没有通过?
but why did Families First fail?

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,800
这种事经常发生 就像天会下雨
It happens. Rain gonna fall,

30
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:18,280
议院司法委员会听证会
白宫是否利用游说者来使它们的提案失败?

31
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,800
酒吧会关门 提案也会被砍
bar's gonna close, bill's gonna fail.

32
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,190
Cafferty先生真会说话 出口成章
There's a job for you at Hallmark, Mr. Cafferty.

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,140
法案没通过你看起来好像也不怎么伤心
You don't seem upset that the bill failed.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,960
如果我有孩子的话 顺便一说我还真有
If I had kids, which actually I do,

35
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,480
这个提案就是我的小宝贝
this bill would be my baby.

36
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,950
我和整个白宫
I and the entire White House,

37
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,040
我们一起在挥洒汗水呕心沥血
we sweated a full transfusion of blood

38
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,700
想让这个提案通过
to pass this bill.

39
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:44,160
不是说Jonah Ryan并非受命支持法案的
So Jonah Ryan wasn't sent here to defend the bill,

40
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,140
而是故意来捣乱的吗?
to deliberately undermine it?

41
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,830
不 不 请看我性感的唇 不
No. No. Read my luscious lips, no.

42
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,330
我们是顾问 而不是说客
We were consultants, not lobbyists.

43
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,470
所以区别在哪?
And what's the difference?

44
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,980
如果你要求咨询
You ask to be consulted.

45
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:58,050
顾问会给客户提建议
A consultant consults the client,

46
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:00,390
然而说客是代表客户游说
whereas a lobbyist lobbies on behalf of the client.

47
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,900
你没跟我说区别啊
You're nrot telling me the difference,

48
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,090
你只是把名词改动词了
you're just turning nouns into verbs.

49
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,570
所以你在建议别人
So you were consulting

50
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,620
给家庭第一提案投反对票?
people to vote against the Families First Bill?

51
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,830
是的 是的 我们就是这么做的
Yes. Yes, we were.

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,570
这确实就是他们一直在干的事
That's exactly what they were doing.

53
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,410
抱歉 Ryan先生 我们没问你的意见
Excuse me, Mr. Ryan. We didn't ask for your commentary

54
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,520
或是让你证明他们的证词
on the veracity of their testimonies.

55
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,660
哦 我很抱歉 先生
Oh, I'm very sorry, sir.

56
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:20,440
我很抱歉我的不当行为
I'm sorry that I misconducted myself

57
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,530
我以后不会这么做了
and I will not do that in to the future.

58
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,830
你对于Brookheimer女士和Egan先生的评价是什么?
What is your assessment of Ms. Brookheimer and Mr. Egan?

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,250
噢 Brookheimer女士是一个坚强
Oh, Ms. Brookheimer is a strong,

60
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,150
独立 处事灵活的女性
independent, flexible woman.

61
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,650
并且上帝知道华盛顿就缺这种类型的
And Lord knows there aren't enough of those in DC.

62
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:35,770
Egan先生呢?
And Mr. Egan?

63
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,330
呃 Dan Egan大概十分里面能给五分半 不太够六分吧
Uh, Dan Egan is a solid five and a half, weak six.

64
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,980
你能告诉我们是谁导致了数据的泄露吗?
Can you tell us who was responsible for the data breach?

65
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:47,120
不能 呃 我指 是的
No. Well, I mean, yes.

66
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,630
是的 公众都知道
Yes, it's a matter of public record

67
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:50,470
Dan Egan因为和数据泄露有关
that Dan Egan was fired

68
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,890
所以被炒鱿鱼了
because of his relation to the data breach.

69
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,760
我是指 你百度一下也会知道啊
I mean, you could have Googled that.

70
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:58,310
等下 这不是我的问题
Wait, that's not my question.

71
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,730
他是否应该为数据泄露负责?
Was he responsible?

72
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:02,570
华盛顿需要一个牺牲
Washington needed a sacrifice,

73
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,370
所以我们都跑去拿出我们的草耙子
so we all ran and took out our pitchforks

74
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,520
然后点火把柴火Dan给烧了
and we set fire to the wicker Dan.

75
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,710
哦 那如果他是无辜的话 为什么要离开?
Okay, so why did he deserve to go if he was innocent?

76
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,580
你说的好像应该发生的和实际发生的
You make it sound like there's a correlation

77
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,380
有关联一样
between what should happen and what actually happens.

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,770
我是想说 生活如此混乱 总有不公平
I mean, life is chaotic and it's often unfair.

79
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,420
至少我就是这样
I know it is for me.

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,600
Dan Egan活该离职
Dan Egan deserved to go,

81
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,010
所以他离开了
so he went.

82
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
我承认我喜欢钱
Sure, I love money.

83
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,870
但我还爱别的
But there's something else that I love

84
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,000
那就是这个叫美利坚合众国的小姑娘
and it's a little lady called the United States of America.

85
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,150
而今天我和Brookgheimer女士在此正是作为爱国者的身份
And Ms. Brookheimer and I are here today as patriots

86
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,430
来为平常百姓说话
speaking up for the common citizen,

87
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:45,040
为个人亦或是公司
be that individual an actual person or a corporation.

88
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,230
拔高自己硬装逼
That shoehorned stab at nobility

89
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,840
- 在这儿是行不通的- 明白
- will not fly here. - Okay.

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,840
Brookheimer女士 你们是纯粹只认钱吗?
Ms. Brookheimer, are you guided purely by money?

91
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,280
我觉得很有趣
I think it's interesting

92
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,690
你居然选择我来回答这个问题
that you chose me to aim that question at,

93
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:01,360
仿佛是在暗示 我就是个唯利是图
insinuating that I am a money-grabbing,

94
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,940
一心追求名利, 没有道德水准的人
careerist, low-moraled--

95
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,660
我不知道为什么我居然在帮你说话
I don't know why I'm helping you here.

96
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,510
Brookheimei女士 你声音没有必要那么尖厉
There is no need to be shrill, Ms. Brookheimer.

97
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,780
- 有吗? - 嗯
- Shrill? - Mmm.

98
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,090
你是否还记得一份分享在J盘上
Do you recall a document shared on the J-drive

99
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,540
名为 Jona蛋的文档
titled the Jonad Files?

100
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,860
- 呃 不 不记得 女士 - 不 没有什么印象
- Uh, no. No, ma'am. - No. That doesn't ring a bell.

101
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,960
所以Jona蛋也不是Jonah和蛋蛋的组合词?
So it's not a word combining Jonah and gonad?

102
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,520
- 据我所知并不是这样 - 我能证明
- Not to my knowledge. - I can confirm

103
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:26,390
事实上就是那样 并且Egan先生他也知道
that that is exactly what it is and Mr. Egan knows that.

104
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,050
事实上, Egan先生, 我还被告知你鼓励身边的职员们
In fact, Mr. Egan, I was told that you encouraged staffers

105
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,890
加入到侮辱性词汇的使用中
to add to this glossary of abuse.

106
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,990
我现在一时半会儿真想不起来我有这么做过
I do not at this moment in time recall the action

107
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:36,100
也不记得你问的那个文件
nor the document in question.

108
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,800
好吧 可能这个能激发你的记忆 我们摘录了几段
Okay, maybe this will jog your memory. We have some extracts.

我们非得把这些都念出来吗?
Do we have to go through all of these?

112
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,340
我从中并看不出有什么关联
I'm not sure that I see the relevance.

113
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,520
证人们声称他们对他们前同事十分尊敬
The witnesses claim they held their former colleague

114
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,840
我这是在尝试证明事实并非如此
in high regard and I am attempting to prove otherwise.

115
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,750
好吧 没错 是这样 那行 你继续吧

My college friends called me Tall McCartney.

125
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,770
我更喜欢这个 这是个好昵称
I preferred that. That's a good nickname.

126
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,110
难以控制的裂缝已经在你们的关系里产生
Fractious cracks have opened up in your relationships

127
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,100
这同时也反应在了你的证词里 这些我们会在接下来的审议中深究
and in your testimony and we'll explore them in a later session.

128
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:32,980
你是否向上帝发誓
Do you solemnly swear that

129
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,620
你尽其所知
the testimony you're about to give is the truth,

130
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,590
所述之言纯属实言并且无任何隐瞒?
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

131
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,370
我愿意
I do.

132
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,860
你是在四月从白宫被解雇 请问这是否属实?
You were fired from the White House in April. Is that correct?

133
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,260
是的  但我戏虐的内心更喜欢把这称为
Yes. The drama queen in me likes to say

134
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,800
他们在复活节把我给祭了
that they sacrificed me at Easter.

135
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,650
呃 你一直外界被认为是替罪羊
Uh, you've been described as the scapegoat.

136
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,060
那事实上你是否对这次的HIV数据泄露有责任?
Were you in fact responsible for the HIV data breach?

137
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,860
没有 我向来很注重保密
No, I value confidentiality

138
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,980
但自相矛盾的是 我并不注重谁知道我这一点
and paradoxically I don't care who knows it.

139
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,130
那你为什么被解雇呢?
Why were you fired?

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,690
为了掩盖这背后更大的秘密
To conceal something bigger.

141
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,700
他们把我当耗子一样不当回事
They thought I was a mouse.

142
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,670
但他们错了 这只老鼠是会咆哮的
Well, this mouse will roar.

143
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:11,720
Patterson女士 你最好跟我们说说那个更大的秘密
Ms. Patterson, you better tell us what that something bigger is.

144
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,490
竞选活动中的某人使用了联邦数据泄露事件中的
Someone from the campaign used child mortality data

145
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:16,070
儿童死亡率的数据
from the same federal breach

146
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,220
就是说Jennifer Grahm是艾滋病童的同一批数据
that named Jennifer Graham as an HIV victim.

147
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,310
使用该数据是为了什么目的?
Used to what end?

148
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,870
为了故意给丧子的家长们
To deliberately target bereaved parents

149
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,300
发送一封名为 我在乎 的竞选邮件
for a campaign mailer called I Care.

150
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,940
好的 接下来我会这么做
Okay, so this is how it's gonna work.

151
00:06:29,090 --> 00:07:04,600
证词

152
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,860
我会把你们想要的一切放在一个
I'm gonna give you everything you need in a nice little box

153
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,220
用红丝带系着的小盒子里
with a pretty red ribbon on

154
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,600
之后我就重获自由 好吗?
it and then I'm gonna walk away a free man, okay?

155
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,940
- 麻溜儿的 行吗? - 开始吧
- Rat and roll. Deal? - Go on.

156
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,490
关于Lee Patterson--
The thing about Lee Patterson--

157
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,300
她根本不知道自己怎么就成了替罪羊
she doesn't even know why she was scapegoated.

158
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,090
好吗? 但我知道 是因为那份儿童死亡数据的用途是--
Okay? I do. It's because the child mortality data was used--

159
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,780
对 是为了拉拢痛失孩子的父母们 我们已经知道了
Yeah, was used to target bereaved parents. We know that already.

160
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,680
Ms. Patterson's现在正在接受委员会的询问
Ms. Patterson's talking to the committee right now.

161
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,500
是的 - 好吧 再说点深入的
Yes. - Okay, going deeper here.

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,870
那份数据其实是是和--
That data was actually taken from the same--

163
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,660
恩 是和那个艾滋病女孩事件
Yeah, it was from the same breach

164
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,230
出自同一次数据外泄
which identified the HIV girl.

165
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,140
- 我们也都知道了 - 嗯哼
- We know all that. - Mm-hmm.

166
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,460
各位 我们的协议还有效 是吧?
Guys, we still have a deal, right?

167
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:07,300
你意识到你对这次数据外泄的指认
Ms. Patterson, you are aware that your accusations

168
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,580
将对你和其他人
about the data breach will

169
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,030
都产生十分严重的影响
have serious repercussions for you and the others?

170
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,500
我明白之中的危险
I understand the dangers

171
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:15,010
也明白您提醒我的好意
and how you're well-placed to remind me of them.

172
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,670
你是在暗示我和总统夫人的私人友谊
You're insinuating that my close personal friendship

173
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:19,860
影响了我的判断力?
with the president might cloud my judgment?

174
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,160
不是 完全不是
No, not at all.

175
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:25,060
女士 您的判断力 是无可挑剔的
Your judgment, ma'am, is unimpeachable.

176
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,900
总统夫人了解这次数据外泄吗?
Did the president know about the data breach?

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,400
不 只是她身边的那些人
No, just the people around her.

178
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,870
Bill Ericsson和Gary Walsh与她最为亲近
Bill Ericsson and Gary Walsh were closest to her.

179
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,460
这就是我为什么知道Bill Ericsson--
Which is how I know that Bill Ericsson--

180
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,990
了解数据外泄的事
Knew about the data breach.

181
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,530
您脑子里的信号是不是有点延迟了 Mr. Egan?
Are you on some kind of satellite delay, Mr. Egan?

182
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,100
没有对Lee Patterson女士不敬的意思
With respect to Lee Patterson,

183
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,730
但她完全不明白都发生了什么
she had no real idea, no concept of what was actually happening.

184
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,750
我是说 她级别太低了
I mean, she was so junior,

185
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,300
她也许还同时在后厨工作呢
she may have well been working in the kitchens,

186
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,700
我没有瞧不起厨房工作的意思
with all due respect to the kitchens.

187
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:53,840
我郑重声明 Ms. Patterson是一名非常有能力的员工
But for the record, Ms. Patterson was a very competent staffer

188
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,340
她就是Jimmy Cagney口中的那些
and what Jimmy Cagney would have called

189
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,570
好孩子 在我看来
a good kid in my opinion.

190
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:01,610
我等着被提问吧
I'll wait for a question.

191
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,990
我们有一位证人的证词
We have a deposition from a witness

192
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,160
指认你 Mr. Ericsson
confirming that you, Mr. Ericsson,

193
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,720
安排Dan Egan去开除Ms. Patterson
ordered Dan Egan to fire Ms. Patterson.

194
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
这就是我所害怕的 我正在被滚雪球
This is what I was afraid of. I'm being snowballed.

195
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,660
- 我是滚雪球的牺牲者 - 你是什么意思Mr. Ericsson?
- I'm a victim of snowballing. - What do you mean, Mr. Ericsson?

196
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,590
就是一个名字被提了 就会反复被提
Well, a name gets mentioned, then gets mentioned again,

197
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,980
不久所有人都会提
and pretty soon everyone is mentioning it

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,280
然后所有的事都像雪球越滚越大
and then the whole thing snowballs

199
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,120
最后雪球汇聚成一场雪崩
and then there's an avalanche of snowballs

200
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:22,290
我就被别人的雪活埋了
and I'm being buried by other people's snow

201
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,390
还不是纯白的雪
and it's not pure driven,

202
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:25,000
我说的也不是真的雪 如果您明白我的意思
it's not white snow, if you catch my drift.

203
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,880
我一定给他们说明白了 我说明白了吗?
I certainly caught their drift. Do I make sense?

204
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,790
- 我讲通了吗? - 冷静-- 冷静一下
- Am I making sense? - Calm-- calm down.

205
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,300
你开除Lee Patterson女士
Isn't snowballing

206
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,430
的行为不就是在向她滚雪球吗?
what you did to Lee Patterson when you had her fired?

207
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,730
不 那是栽赃
No, that was scapegoating.

208
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,330
再一次道歉
Again, apologies.

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,810
您并没有向我提问
You haven't asked me a question.

210
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,850
栽赃和滚雪球效应 两者有什么区别吗?
What is the difference between scapegoating and snowballing?

211
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,420
栽赃与我无关 这就是区别
It's not my fault. That's the difference.

212
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,580
这个-- 这讲通了吗?
Is that-- is that making sense?

213
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,220
那不是我的错 我的重点是这个
It's not my fault is my basic point.

214
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,900
我想说 我身边坐的就是一位竞选经理
I mean, why I am being raked over the coals

215
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,040
为什么泄露的数据
for the misuse of data in the

216
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,120
被竞选活动滥用 却只有我被谴责?
campaign when I'm sitting next to the campaign manager?

217
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,600
噢 这真是-- 好样的 Bill 干得好
Oh, that's-- bravo, Bill. Subtly done.

218
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,350
Mr. Davison 你是President Meyer的竞选经理 是吧?
Mr. Davison, you are President Meyer's campaign manager, yes?

219
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:04,000
是的 女士 但不是在数据泄露的时候
Yes, ma'am. Though not at the time of the breach.

220
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,000
然而你当时已经意识到了事态的发展
But you were aware of it at the time

221
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,490
却选择缄口不言?
and yet you chose to say nothing?

222
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,720
那个时候 在表面上还看不出什么端倪
Well, though it may appear that there was nothing going on,

223
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,890
但我可以向您保证有--
I can assure you that there was--

224
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,260
有很多事情正在暗地里发生
there was lots going on underneath.

225
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:20,500
,就像天鹅和霍金教授一样看不出动作
Like a swan or Professor Hawking.

226
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,650
还有谁参与了?
Who else, then, was involved?

227
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:51,800
证词

228
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,770
Gary Gary Walsh
Gary. Gary Walsh.

229
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,850
总统夫人的提包男?
The president's bagman?

230
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,900
是 他就像是那种人
Yeah, he's the guy.

231
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,190
但是-- 你看过"非常嫌疑犯"吗?
But-- okay, you ever seen "Usual Suspects"?

232
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,500
没有看过
I haven't seen it.

233
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:38,860
好吧 他就像是Keyser-- 我是说--
Okay, well, he's Keyser-- I mean--

234
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,320
你没看过 算了
you haven't seen it, so forget it.

235
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,880
Gary就是那个拖我和Amy Brookheimer下水的人
Gary's the guy who got Amy Brookheimer and I involved.

236
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,370
他是个提包男 对 但他也是个坏人
He's the bagman, yeah, but he's also the bad man.

237
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,090
Walsh先生 有些人
Mr. Walsh, several people

238
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,250
现在认为你是整个事件的核心人物
have now described you as being at the center of events,

239
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
所以我想知道你是否能描述一下
so I was wondering if you could please outline to us

240
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:10,660
你的工作职责
your duties and your responsibilities.

241
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,690
Walsh先生 有什么问题吗?
Is there a problem, Mr. Walsh?

242
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,400
抱歉 我只是--
I'm sorry. It's just when I was--

243
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,490
最初我被传唤过过来 只说是一个小型听证会
when I was originally summoned, it was a smaller hearing

244
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,540
我放弃行政豁免权就来了
and executive privileges were waived

245
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,890
而现在这里就像周杰伦演唱会现场
and now it's like a U2 concert.

246
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,890
好了 我们正在调查你的玩忽职守
Well, we are investigating malpractice

247
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,800
看你是不是犯了罪需要刑事调查
possibly leading to criminal investigation.

248
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:34,250
你需要履行你的行政豁免权么?
Might you unwaive your executive privilege?

249
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,350
呃哈 他说不 所以...
Uh-huh. He says not to, so...

250
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,970
你和Dan Egan关系不错?
Would you say you were friendly with Dan Egan?

251
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,570
是 我和他关系不错
Yes, I'm friendly with Dan Egan.

252
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,720
我-我们是朋友 对
I-- we're friends, yes.

253
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,590
在第一家庭提案投票的那天
You were seen with him and Amy Brookheimer

254
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,110
有人看到你和他还有Amy Brookheimer在一起
on the day of the Families First vote.

255
00:10:59,110 --> 00:10:59,910
对
Yeah.

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,820
Dan不是我的朋友
Dan is not my friend.

257
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,670
他只是我的同事
He's a colleague.

258
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,490
我不知道为什么我刚刚说我俩是朋友
I don't know why I said we were friends.

259
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,610
我的错-- 只是我相信
That's a fault of mine-- just kind of believing

260
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,690
有些人曾经是朋友 而现在不再是朋友
that people were friends and they're not friends.

261
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,950
自我中学年代起就是这样了
It's kind of been going on since middle school

262
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,850
你正好让我不恰当的时候说漏了嘴
and you just caught me at a bad time.

263
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,020
你和Egan先生保持距离可能是明智的
You're probably correct to distance yourself from Mr. Egan.

264
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,600
那你怎样描述
How would you describe

265
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,830
你和总统之间的工作关系?
your working relationship with the president?

266
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,860
呃 非常亲密
Uh, it's very intimate.

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,510
我经常把自己当做是一个信息渠道
I've always imagined myself as like a pipeline

268
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:37,090
我收集很多重要信息
who carries a lot of necessary information

269
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,480
并且直接将信息传送给总统
and I just feed it directly into her head.

270
00:11:40,240 --> 00:12:01,800
证词

271
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,090
总统女士 我想确认你是否已经放弃了你的总统行政特权?
Madam President, can I confirm you've waived executive privilege?

272
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:43,970
是的
Yes.

273
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,370
我可以告诉你
Though it is no privilege to have to endure

274
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,610
虽然此次调查中不需要任何特权
this investigation, I can tell you that.

275
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:51,190
但我很高兴我能够协助调查
But I'm happy to assist in any way that I can.

276
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,680
- 你能谈谈你在竞选材料中使用泄露的联邦数据的事吗? - 不能
Can you tell me anything about the breach of federal data used in your campaign material? - No.

277
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,690
你刚刚才说你要尽力协助调查
You said that you'd help this inquiry in any way.

278
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,510
对 我的确说了
Yes, and I have just then.

279
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:05,480
总统知道游说
Did the president know about the lobbying

280
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,880
让家庭第一提案不通过的事情吗?
against the Families First Bill?

281
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,810
我只是个无名小卒
I'm a nobody.

282
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,890
真的 我只是个小人物
That's the truth. I'm a nobody.

283
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,540
我只是个小人物 在总统耳边嘀咕几个名字
I'm just the guy that, like, whispers names

284
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,360
和告诉她人们的资料
to the president and I tell her facts about people.

285
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,190
所以说你只是一个提词人?
So you're just a prompter?

286
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,790
我是提词的人 这是真的
I'm a man who prompts, that is correct.

287
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,630
那么你说的关于
So all the talk of being the

288
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,450
那你是总统的信息渠道都是吹牛的?
president's pipeline was just bigheadedness?

289
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,910
没错 是的
Yeah. Yeah.

290
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,540
我是个自大的人
I'm an arrogant man.

291
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,380
我不是一个有权有势有过错的自大的人
I'm not a powerful, guilty, arrogant man.

292
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,840
我是个自大的人
I'm an arrogant man.

293
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:49,560
换句话说 你和说客都没有联系?
So you wouldn't have contact, in other words, with lobbyists?

294
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,090
不 不
No. No.

295
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:56,120
事实上 Catherine的未婚夫Jason是个说客
Actually, Catherine's fiance Jason is a lobbyist,

296
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,180
所以 我有时和说客有联系
so at times, yeah.

297
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,980
是么? 目前他还被认为是个顾问
Really? Until now he's been referred to as a consultant.

298
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:07,560
你对你女儿和一个说客订婚有顾虑吗?
Are you concerned with your daughter being engaged to a lobbyist?

299
00:13:04,330 --> 00:14:01,600
证词

300
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,520
不 完全没有
No, not at all.

301
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,320
他也不是个真正的说客
And he's not actually a lobbyist.

302
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,140
他是个顾问 所以--
He's a consultant, so--

303
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,320
但是你的拎包人Gary Walsh
But your bagman Gary Walsh

304
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,330
说他是一个说客
referred to him as a lobbyist.

305
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,210
嗯 Gary的能力很有限
Um, Gary has a very limited set of skills.

306
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,200
他们工作的主要内容就是 把东西拿起来
Mainly I would say they are picking objects up

307
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,090
再原样放回去
and then putting objects back down.

308
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,990
他说他负责解决你的卫生问题
He said he takes care of your sanitary needs.

309
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,950
是这样吗?
Is that correct?

310
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,340
是-- 是-- 什么?
Yeah-- yeah-- what?

311
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,340
你说你女儿的未婚夫 Read先生不是说客
You say your daughter's fianc Mr. Read is not a lobbyist,

312
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,960
然而 Merryman & Cotter公司
and yet the firm of Merryman & Cotter

313
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,480
在公司官网"我们的说客"部分
lists him under the title of lobbyist

314
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,600
将他列在了说客名单上
in the "Our lobbyists" Section of its website.

315
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,800
那是他们的说辞 并不是我的说法
Well, that's their word. That's not my word.

316
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,960
他是基督教互援会 乐施会
He is a lobbyist for Christian Aid, Oxfam,

317
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,300
及世界卫生组织的说客
the World Health Organization.

318
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,370
嗯 无论你用哪种方式称呼他
Mm-hmm, well, he sounds like a decent guy,

319
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,810
听起来似乎都很体面
whatever you want to call him.

320
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,500
同时他还为医药企业
Also lobbying for pharmaceutical companies,

321
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:01,100
大型IT组织 投资银行进行游说
large IT organizations, investment banks.

322
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:03,940
是的 我未婚夫是说客
Yes, my fianc√? is a lobbyist.

323
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,660
这给你们的关系带来困难了吗?
Does that present any difficulties in your relationship?

324
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,250
除了我现在坐在一间屋子里
Not apart from the fact that I am now sitting in a room

325
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,490
对着一个镜头和两个陌生人谈论此事之外 并没有什么影响
with two strangers talking about it on camera.

326
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:13,900
你不喜欢被质问?
You don't like being questioned?

327
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,160
不喜欢被问及个人私生活 不 我并不喜欢
Not about my personal life, no, I don't.

328
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,940
难道你喜欢? 当然了 前提是你有私生活
I mean, do you? Assuming that you have one.

329
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,600
我看你手上没带戒指 所以...
I don't see that you're wearing a ring, so...

330
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,630
Meyer小姐 我们要稍微提醒一下我们是在做证词采集
Ms. Meyer, you're gently reminded that this is a deposition.

331
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:24,410
下一次我就不会这么客气了
I won't be as polite next time.

332
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,660
嗯 抱歉 我能休息一下吗?
Um, I'm sorry. Can I please take a minute?

333
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:29,960
可以 当然可以 - 谢谢
Sure, yeah. Of course. - Thank you.

334
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,110
刚才真是抱歉 我刚刚出去吃了点东西
I'm sorry about that. I just had to get a snack.

335
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,160
我低血糖 所以...
My blood sugar was dropping, so...

336
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,300
没事
That's okay.

337
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:42,050
你没觉得这里面存在利益冲突吗?
Do you not see the conflict of interest?

338
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:44,180
我是指 我们正在调查说客和你方政府
I mean, we are investigating direct links

339
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,590
之间的直接联系 - 是 我发现了
- between lobbyists and your administration. - Yes, I see it.

340
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,640
- 这难道和你无关吗?
- Does it not concern you?

341
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,340
- 如果你能让我说完我的话
- If you would just let me finish my sentence,

342
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,810
我会非常感激
that would be very much appreciated.

343
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,140
我确实知道这里面有冲突
I do see it.

344
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,480
同时我认为
It is also my understanding

345
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:01,020
他们可能已经解除婚约了
that they may no longer be engaged.

346
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,750
所以...
So...

347
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,690
他们分手了吗?
They've split up?

348
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,380
嗯 我想...
Um, I think...

349
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,430
他们可能已经分手了
they may have split up.

350
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:15,050
另外 我还想说的是 我真的不确定
In addition to that, I will say that I'm really not certain

351
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,790
Jason就是适合Catherin的那个人
that Jac-- Ja-- Jason was ever right for Catherine.

352
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,470
可你刚刚说过他人很好
But you just said that he was sweet.

353
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,710
呃-嗯 他有时候人是很好
Mm-hmm. He can be sweet at one moment

354
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,970
但他下一秒又会变得很强势
and then he can be very controlling in the next moment.

355
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,090
你懂的 为乐施会 还有医药公司游说
You know, lobbying for Oxfam, or then lobbying for PhRMA.

356
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,880
我是说 咨询
And I meant consulting.

357
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:34,400
我必须离开一下 我得给非洲总统打个电话
I have to go. I've got to call the president of Africa.

358
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:38,080
所以-- 我是指南非 你懂的 所以...
So-- I mean South Africa specifically, you know, so...

359
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,740
Wilson女士 我们了解到
Ms. Wilson, it has been said of you

360
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:45,200
你是个可以在组织诺曼底登陆战役的同时
that you could organize the D-Day landings

361
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:47,750
仍然有时间布置硫磺岛战役的人
and still have time left over for Iwo Jima.

362
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,180
而且 与现实有别的是 我布置的硫磺岛战役会赢得更轻松
And, unlike in reality, I would have gotten Iwo Jima right.

363
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,050
尽管如此 总统和
And yet this meeting between the president

364
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:55,440
议员Pierce的这次会议
and Congressman Pierce,

365
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:58,050
并没有出现在你的日程记录里
you have no record of that in your schedule.

366
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,240
Pierce议员和总统的会议并不倾向于
Congressman Pierce was not disposed

367
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,340
一个预示为会议的行为
in a manner that was indicative of a meeting.

368
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,090
我没听懂你这话是什么意思
I literally have no idea what that sentence means.

369
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:05,840
遇见某人和会见
There's a difference between

370
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,260
是有区别的
meeting someone and having a meeting with them.

371
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,840
我的意思是 我有一次遇见了Bill Gates
I mean, I once met Bill Gates,

372
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,760
但我并没有和他“开会”
but I didn't have a "Meeting" With him.

373
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:14,560
我们保留严谨且详尽的
We keep meticulous, exhaustive records

374
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,850
电子邮件和语音备忘录
of emails, voice memos,

375
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,480
以及短信 信件的记录
text messages, letters--

376
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,410
主席 我们有所有的电子邮件 信件 短信记录
Chairman, we have all the emails, letters, texts,

377
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:25,490
但你提到了语音备忘录 Wilson女士
but you mentioned voice memos, Ms. Wilson.

378
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,600
是的
Yes.

379
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,330
我们有各种不同的沟通形式
Well, we have many forms of communication.

380
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,810
现在看来
None of which you seem

381
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,730
你似乎不精通其中任何一种
to be able to master at the present moment.

382
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,140
我并不负责语音备忘录的管理
Well, I wasn't responsible for the voice memos.

383
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,290
- 那么谁是管理... - Mike McLintock
- So who would know about-- - Mike McLintock.

384
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,020
McLintock先生 请起立
Mr. McLintock, please rise

385
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,970
举起你的右手
and raise your right hand.

386
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,890
你是否向上帝庄严宣誓
Do you solemnly swear that

387
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,090
你尽其所知
the testimony you're about to give is the truth,

388
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:05,410
所述之言纯属实言并且无任何隐瞒?
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

389
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,060
向上帝起誓 是的
So help me God. I do.

390
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,630
我们的一名正式的证人称
We have a witness go on record

391
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,070
看到你和Egan先生
saying that they saw you in the White House parking lot

392
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,400
Brookheimer女士 Pierce参议员曾一起出现在白宫停车场
with Mr. Egan, Ms. Brookheimer, and Senator Pierce.

393
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,990
没错
That's correct.

394
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:23,120
我碰巧遇到他们
I ran into them by chance

395
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:27,680
当时我只是去车里拿东西
because I was merely getting something from my car.

396
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:30,210
- 你当时去拿什么? - 什么?
- What were you getting? - I'm sorry?

397
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,220
你当时去拿什么?
What were you getting?

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,810
我去拿 拿药
Uh, I was getting some medicine.

399
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,200
什么药?
What kind of medicine?

400
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,900
膝盖药
Um, it's knee medicine.

401
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,550
膝盖药?
Knee medicine?

402
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,330
是的 膝盖药
Yeah, knee medicine.

403
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:47,750
用在 只用在一个膝盖上
For one of-- just one of my knees.

404
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,460
- 哪一个? - 哪一个膝盖吗?
- Which one? - Which knee?

405
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,560
我的左 左膝盖 法官大人 先生
My left-- left knee, Your Honor, sir.

406
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,280
我的左膝盖 我的左膝盖有问题
My left knee. I have problems with my left knee.

407
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,380
蹲下的时候会疼
Um, it hurts when I crouch.

408
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,390
药物的名字是什么?
What was the name of the medicine?

409
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,980
我想是叫...
Um, I want to say it's called...

410
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,830
蹲膏
Crouch Cream.

411
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:09,920
然而并不是这个名字
But that's not right.

412
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,520
是一个带红色标签的白色管子
It's a white tube with a red label.

413
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,810
一个实习生都能够查到这药
I'm sure an intern could research this.

414
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,830
有一个马的剪影在上面
It has a silhouette of a horse on it.

415
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,820
我不知道为什么要放个马在上面
I don't know why the horse is on there.

416
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,770
我猜可能是因为马的膝盖很强壮吧
I guess horses probably have good knees.

417
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,710
所以... 但我想它是叫...
So, um-- but I think it's called...

418
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,650
膝盖-Z 膝盖-Z膏

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,760
我想不是的 但是能搜到的

420
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,200
我很确定
I'm very positive.

421
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:38,850
谢谢你允许我去处理那些总统事务
Thank you for allowing me to attend to presidential matters.

422
00:18:38,730 --> 00:19:26,800
证词

423
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,870
我们仍然想询问关于您女儿和Read先生
We still wish to consider the outstanding issues

424
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,520
尚未说清楚的事情
concerning your daughter and Mr. Read.

425
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,670
他们确实已经分手了
Who have definitely split up.

426
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,700
我很烦乱 真的很难过
I'm quite undone. I'm really upset.

427
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,680
我在这段时间里越来越喜欢Jason
Um, I had grown quite fond of dear Jason.

428
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,650
您曾经说他对于您女儿太老了
You've said he's too old for your daughter

429
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,410
而且他有控制欲 还有双重人格
and that he can be controlling and that he has two personalities.

430
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,820
我有份声明要宣读

432
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,600
我的女儿Catherine与Jason Read解除婚约
of my daughter Catherine's engagement to Jason Read.

433
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,130
这是由于一些私人原因
This was for personal reasons unconnected

434
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:15,110
与针对我方政府正在进行的调查没有关系
to the ongoing inquiries into my administration

435
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,870
不过调查可能给他们之间的关系
other than the strain said inquiries brought

436
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,360
带来了压力
upon their relationship.

437
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:24,040
今天对于真相来说是个日子
This may be a good day for truth,

438
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,620
但对于爱情却是伤心的一天
but a sad day for love.

439
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,880
你推荐了一个应用给总统
You recommended an app for the president,

440
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,630
- 是吗 - 是的 女士
- did you not? - Yes, ma'am.

441
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:34,540
你能在你的手机上演示一下如何使用这个应用吗?
Could you demonstrate how the app works on your phone?

442
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,020
是的 非常乐意
Yes, I'd be happy to.

443
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,890
你点开主页
So you go to your home screen, it's called.

444
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:40,950
记住这一点
Remember that.

445
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,820
现在你要决定发给谁
And now you have to send it to someone.

446
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:44,220
所以我要发给...
So I could send it to...

447
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,880
你能给我你的号码吗?
you want to give me your number?

448
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,630
- 要不我就发给我自己 - 好的
- Or I'll just send it to myself. - Fine.

449
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,300
现在我要做的就是恰当地
So now all I do is appropriately touch

450
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:55,210
触摸这个按钮来录音
the icon for record.

451
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:57,350
你好 Mike 我是Mike
And-- hey, Mike, it's Mike.

452
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,320
嗯...
Um...

453
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:02,750
你可能收不到
you're probably not going to get this

454
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,870
因为你正在一个听证会上 但是我...
'cause you're in the hearings, but I just...

455
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:07,520
- 想告诉你... - 足够了
- wanted to tell you-- - That's quite enough.

456
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:08,460
我得挂了 Mike
I've got to go, Mike.

457
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,250
然后只要按发送键
And then you just press send.

458
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,980
它就会马上出现在我的备忘录应用里了
And it should instantly appear on my memo app.

459
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:21,160
怎么没有 呃 我也不知道怎么回事
Which it's not doing. Um, I don't know why.

460
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,480
大概这就是为什么他们
I guess that's why they

461
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,830
说不要和动物或科技一起工作吧
say don't work with animals or technology.

462
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,110
所以<大白鲨>的拍摄过程才如此可怕
I mean, that's why "Jaws" Was such a nightmare shoot.

463
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,830
我指的是 机器鲨鱼 当我没说
I mean, mechanical shark, forget it.

464
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,530
哦 膝盖无忧 这就是药的名字
Oh, Knee Free. That's the cream.

465
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,950
膝盖无忧 你只要--
- Knee Free, if you-- -

466
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,190
好了 听吧
Okay, here it is.

467
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,880
-- 你好 Mike 我是Mike
And-- hey, Mike, it's Mike.

468
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,260
嗯...
Um...

469
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,230
你可能收不到
you're probably not going to get this

470
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,380
因为你正在一个听证会上 但是...
'cause you're in the hearings, but--

471
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:46,880
还挺清晰的
Pretty good clarity.

472
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,100
我们能听几句总统发的消息吗?
Could we hear some of the messages that the president sent?

473
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,490
不行 因为我删掉了信息 都被我删掉了
No, because I deleted them. They're deleted.

474
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,710
说实话 都是关于
I mean, truthfully, these things were just

475
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,980
她谈论些止疼药什么的 没什么重要的
her talking about Advil and lemons.

476
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,980
我们听的时候会进行判断
Well, we'll see how many when we listen to them.

477
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,310
很抱歉 先生 我都删掉了
Sadly, sir, I deleted those.

478
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:04,120
我知道 但是云端不是还有吗
Yeah, but they still exist in the cloud,

479
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,320
你应该很清楚这一点吧
as I'm sure you're aware.

480
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,460
Ben Dan和Amy在上了吗?
Selina's voice: Ben, are Dan and Amy on course?

481
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,330
这绝不可能
It can't happen.

482
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,160
呃 这可以指的东西可多了
Well, that could be about anything.

483
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:19,550
可能是说他们...
Probably about them...

484
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,080
比如 性交
you know, mating.

485
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,890
说这不可能?
And it can't happen?

486
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,600
是说我们绝不可能选举失败
It can't happen that we lose this vote.

487
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,400
是不是你觉得有点牵强了?
Or is that too far-fetched for you?

488
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,110
好吧 那她为什么会提到这个?
Well, why did she mention it, then?

489
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,720
呃 她当时在发烧 不太清醒
Well, she was feverish.

490
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,170
所以你是说以她当时状态不适合管理国家是吗?
So you're saying she wasn't in a fit state to govern?

491
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,980
不 我可没这么说
No, I'm not saying that.

492
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,320
如果我要这么说的话 那我当时就说了
If I was saying that, then that's what I would have said.

493
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:46,240
我是说 你为啥要妄想拿石头攻击一辆坦克呢?
I mean, why are you throwing pebbles at a tank?

494
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,910
别这样了
Stop.

495
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,340
你要知道 就算是麻疯病(腐败)You know, that lady, she could govern herself

496
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,750
也丝毫不能影响那位女士的工作
rough leprosy.

497
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,630
您是怎样看待您和
How would you characterize your friendship

498
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,830
议员Bennett之间的友谊的呢?
with Congresswoman Bennett?

499
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:59,540
呃 我倒不觉得我们是朋友
Uh, well, I wouldn't say that we're friends.

500
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,460
或许说我们之间很友好更合适
I would say that we are friendly.

501
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:05,010
所以她在委员会里 并不会刻意回避
So she's not on the committee to steer them away

502
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,100
对您不利的话题 对吗?
from issues that might be uncomfortable for you?

503
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:09,050
不会 嗯
No. Mm-mmm.

504
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:10,630
我可是总统
I'm president.

505
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,050
我没有时间来经营友情
I don't have time for friends.

506
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,720
总统女士 是您
Madam President, it was you

507
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,890
指定了一位特别检察官
who appointed a special prosecutor

508
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,890
特别检察官：专职调查牵涉总统的舞弊案 以避免调查过程会受到政府高层及执政党的干涉

509
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:20,890
而我们的团队归这位特检官管辖
and we are the team under your appointee.

510
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,530
嗯 没错
Yeah, well, there you go.

511
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,860
Ryan先生
- Mr. Ryan.

512
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,210
委员会注意到
It has come to this committee's attention

513
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:29,900
你在表决家庭第一提案前
that you suffered some emotional issues

514
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,070
情绪有很大波动
during the run-up to the Families First Bill.

515
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:38,960
我被人摸了
I was touched.

516
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,880
被谁?
Who touched you?

517
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:44,550
我现在不想说
I would rather not say at this time.

518
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,810
以后也不想
Or any.

519
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,170
能告诉我们原因吗?
Can you give us a reason why?

520
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:49,000
抱歉 耽搁两分钟
Excuse me for one moment.

521
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,510
我嘴巴很-很干
I just have a very-- a very dry mouth.

522
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,430
不需要指明身份...
Setting their identity aside...

523
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,930
不需要指明身份
Setting their identity aside,

524
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,270
你在哪儿被此人摸了?
where did this person touch you?

525
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,100
呃...
Um...

526
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:11,160
是摸了我的私处
he touched me in a private place.

527
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:13,750
能再明确点吗? 摸的是你的屁股吗?
Can you be more specific? Was it the buttocks?

528
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,450
不 不
No. No.

529
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,450
是 -是另一面
It was-- it was around the other side.

530
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,760
那就是胯部了
The crotch, presumably.

531
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,710
那请问
Was there ever any contact

532
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:28,120
睾丸和手之间有接触吗?
between testicles and hands?

533
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,460
够了 拜托
Okay, listen,

534
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,380
要判断的不是有没有游说吗?
I thought that this was supposed to be about lobbying.

535
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:35,270
很明显 这位国会女议员所问的问题
And it seems clear that the congresswoman

536
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,140
已经偏离了此次听证会的主题
is pulling focus away from the main concern of this panel.

537
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:43,780
就像Brookheimer女士的穿着打扮一样
Similarly with Ms. Brookheimer's dress.

538
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,370
她自己都无法相信这一身服装是得体的
She can't have believed that this would work.

539
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:48,280
她看上去从未如此谦逊过
She never looks this humble.

540
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,000
我不 我不清楚你在影射什么 Ryan先生
I'm not-- I'm not sure what you're referring to, Mr. Ryan.

541
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,540
我的日常着装就是这样的
This is my everyday attire.

542
00:23:53,570 --> 00:23:56,330
如果这冒犯了您 我非常抱歉 但
And I apologize if it offends you, but...

543
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,580
你们看到她刚才的动作了
But you saw what she just did with the--

544
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,740
你们都看到了对吧
I mean, you saw that.

545
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:03,000
她在玩弄你们 好像你们是廉价的
She is playing you like a cheap--

546
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,970
- 说话注意点  - 就像微软游戏机一样
- Careful. - Like an Xbox.

547
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,240
Ryan先生 相信我 没有人在玩弄我们  我们是不容摆布的
Mr. Ryan, trust me, no one is playing us. We are unplayable.

548
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,790
我想听听关于性骚扰指控的更多细节
I'd like to hear more on the charges of molestation.

549
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:11,560
请继续
Go ahead.
我想听听关于性骚扰指控的更多细节
I'd like to hear more on the charges of molestation.

550
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,750
请继续
Go ahead.

551
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:17,330
他的手曾经接触过你的睾丸吗?
Was there ever any contact between testicles and hands?

552
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,580
不 没有
No. Never.

553
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:23,280
我的 蛋蛋们
My... spheres

554
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,280
一向穿戴整齐
were always clothed.

555
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,160
我当时在工作场所 所以我
I was in the workplace, so I--

556
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,650
他总会同时摸你的两个睾丸吗?
Did he always grope both testicles?

557
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,490
不好意思 能换一个男委员
I'm sorry, but can I be asked that question

558
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,170
来问我这种问题吗?
by a male committee member?

559
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,070
不 由我来问
No, I asked the question.

560
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,390
很抱歉  我忘了你的问题是什么
I'm sorry. I forgot the question.

561
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,250
那个欺凌你的人是不是摸了你的两个睾丸?
Did your abuser touch both of your testicles?

562
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,660
- 谢谢你 Egan先生  - 不客气
- Thank you, Mr. Egan. - Sure.

563
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:45,340
在你的白宫任职期间 还有谁知道这件事情？
Who else was aware of this during your time at the White House?

564
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,700
我 我也亲眼见过
I, uh-- I also saw it.

565
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,060
我没法
I can't stop--

566
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:51,920
我没法不去想它
I can't stop thinking about it.

567
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,920
这 你知道的 就像一个警铃
It's-- you know, it's like a bell.

568
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,150
声响无法停止
It can't be unrung.

569
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,530
这件事发生在哪里
Where did you see it happen?

570
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,230
在他的蛋蛋附近
It was around the spheres.

571
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,490
我是问你是在哪儿目睹了这件事
I meant what area of the workplace.

572
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,170
哦 对 不好意思 没错
Oh, yes. No, I'm sorry. Yes.

573
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:04,580
在一条走廊上
It was in a hallway.

574
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:06,160
和Dan看到的是同一次
Same time as Dan.

575
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,560
事实上 他当时正准备炒了Jonah
In fact, he was coming to fire Jonah as a scapegoat

576
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,790
让他做儿童死亡率数据泄露的替罪羊
for the child mortality data breach. Oh!

577
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,820
- 很好 没有其他问题了 - 等下 等下
- Okay, there's no further questions. - Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

578
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:17,520
等下 等下  你能再复述一遍刚才的话吗? Splett先生
Wait, wait. Can you repeat that, Mr. Splett?

579
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,430
实际上 我希望引用宪法第五条修正案
Uh, actually, I'd like to plead the fifth.

580
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,360
拒不申辩 以免自证其罪
I'd like to plead the fifth, please.

581
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,660
Splett先生 你可以复述
Mr. Splett, can you repeat--

582

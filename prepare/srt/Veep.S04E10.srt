142
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,840
我这个现任总统去处理
with my presidency right now,

143
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,190
所以我真的没有时间
so I don't really have time to

144
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,310
来考虑你说的那些狗屁东西
be thinking about your whatever the fuck it is.

145
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,850
- 可能到来的牢狱之灾 - 没错

146
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,350
- 谢谢您 夫人 - 不用谢
- Thank you, ma'am. - You're welcome.

147
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,600
白宫西翼办公室

148
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:46,400
如果是O'Brien赢了你会怎么办?
What will you do if O'Brien wins?

149
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,400
和Selina一起办公室搬到贝蒂福特戒断康复中心?
Set up an office with Selina at the Betty Ford Clinic?

150
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:51,690
不 我会另谋差事的
No, I've applied for a job outside.

151
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:53,280
政治把我烦的不轻
Politics bores me.

152
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,080
可以说是烦了个彻彻底底明明白白真真切切
It bores the living hell out of me.

153
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,530
天啊 真是烦得很
God, it's boring.

154
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:01,670
Amy不在状态  走神了
Amy looks off her game, distracted.

155
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,590
Amy给我唯一的印象就是东奔西跑
I only really know Amy as the woman who rushed everywhere

156
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,210
紧攥着电话 不知道的还以为攥着的是她的冷冻胚胎呢
clutching her phone like it contained her frozen embryos.

157
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,870
她是个工作狂
She's a workaholic.

158
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,960
拼命工作 来掩饰她
Works frantically to avoid dealing with her weird mix

159
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,180
缺乏自尊而又自恋的扭曲心理
of lack of self-worth and narcissism.

160
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,880
我很喜欢她
I really like her.

161
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,930
呃 夫人 我真心不想一出现就带来坏消息 但是...
Uh, ma'am, I don't mean to be the bearer of bad news, but...

162
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,220
威斯康星州来电 预计是O'Brien赢了
Called Wisconsin. Projected as an O'Brien win.

163
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,060
就是这个坏消息 终归不是我带来的了
That was the bad news, which in the end I didn't bear.

164
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,780
呃 这肯定出乎很多人的预料
Well, this is certainly something not many people saw coming.

165
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:31,950
在我看来 这就是多米诺骨牌效应 暗示着O'Brien今晚的胜利
For me, it's the domino that signals an O'Brien victory tonight.

166
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,730
对O'Brien来说这真是很大的 压倒性的胜利
This is a big, big win for O'Brien,

167
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,400
我想Meyer团队也会感受到的
and I think the Meyer team is gonna be feeling that.

168
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,950
压倒性胜利
The bigness.

169
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,540
嗯
Mm-hmm.

170
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,990
Amy这说明你的前上司已露败象了么?
Amy, is the race already slipping away from your former boss?

171
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,460
不 不
No. No.

172
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,800
呃 还有很多投票没有结束
Um, a lot of the polls have not closed yet.

173
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,250
Amy Brookheimer  CNN前Meyer竞选经纪人

174
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,470
所以 不 不 你懂的 我不这么认为
So, no. No, you know, it's no.

175
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:58,590
我觉得O'Brien会赢得选举
I think O'Brien's gonna win this election.

176
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,260
O'Brien不可能成为总统的
O'Brien can't be president.

177
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,480
他还得按合约继续当肯德基的商标呢
He's still contracted to be the KFC logo.

178
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,560
- 呃... - 你会赢的 夫人
- Eh... - You're gonna win this, ma'am.

179
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,930
- 我不知道 - 你会的
- I don't know. - You are.

180
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:08,600
- 你觉得你会赢吗? - 什么意思?
- You think you would have won? - What do you mean?

181
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,770
如果你是候选人 你觉得你会赢吗?
If you had been the candidate, you think you would have won?

182
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,570
- 那不过是投机的想法罢了 你知道的
-  'Cause that's the speculation, you know.

183
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,070
你觉得呢 Karen?
What do you think, Karen?

184
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:17,940
关于某件具体的事情 还是...?
About something specific, or...?

185
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,780
我和总统是否应该交换身份?
Should the president and I have swapped roles?

186
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:24,280
- 什么情景? - 选举
- For? - For the election.

187
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,830
这次选举 正在进行的这次选举
This election. There's an election going on.

188
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,620
噢 呃 你问我的是假设的问题
Oh, well, you're asking me a hypothetical question

189
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,340
我得好好的回答
and I need to answer it as best I can.

190
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,790
好吧 你刚刚已经做到了
Okay, well, you just did.

191
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,130
太棒了
Great.

192
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:40,770
Amy 我刚刚看到你在电视上情绪不太稳定
Amy, I saw your instability on TV.

193
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,270
收到后给我回电话
Call me when you get this.

194
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,440
如果你不方便的话就让别人替你打号
Get someone else to dial if you're in a straightjacket.

195
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,560
嘿 我在给O'Brien发一些我们这边的数据
Hey, I'm sending some of our data to O'Brien.

196
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,470
如果他赢了 我得去给他舔菊
If he wins this thing, I need to kiss his ass.

197
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,110
是啊 我闪了 我得离开
Mm-hmm. I'm going. I have to go.

198
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,640
什么? 你不能走
What? No, you can't do that.

199
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,310
我得陪着Selina等结果出来
Yeah, no, I have to see this play out with Selina.

200
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,900
我人生三分之一的时间都在为今晚做准备 所以
I've spent a third of my life leading up to this night, so...

201
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,400
Amy...
Amy...

202
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,650
Greg 我得走了
Greg, I have to go.

203
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,210
- 你得走了? - 是的
- You have to go? - Yeah.

204
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,570
这是什么意思? 这又不是夏令营 任你来去
What does that mean? This is not summer camp.

205
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,040
我只是觉得另外一个地方更需要我
Well, I just feel that I'm needed elsewhere.

206
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,330
哦 好啊 那就请离开吧
Oh, well, then please go.

207
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:12,390
反正一些观众
Some of our viewers were

208
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,330
在抱怨你的声音太刺耳...
complaining that you're shrill anyway, so...

209
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,170
哦 刺耳? 不 不 我的声音从不刺耳
Oh, shrill? No, no, I'm never shrill.

210
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,050
那就是… 哦!
And that's... Oh!

211
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:19,890
你搞得像我的声音现在就很刺耳一样
And you're acting as though I'm sounding shrill right now?

212
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,840
好啊 继续保持暗示我声音很刺耳的表情吧
Yeah, yeah, keep making that face implying that I'm shrill.

213
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,310
喂 谁能去停车场看看
Hey, could someone check the parking lot?

214
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,140
我觉着所有的车子都在叫
I think all the alarms are going off.

215
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,560
很遗憾你失去了他
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

216
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,350
我是指威斯康辛 不是指人
I mean about Wisconsin, not a person.

217
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:31,350
嗷! 操!
Ow! Fuck!

218
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,650
我忘了 我的鞋子和地毯气场不和（静电）
I forgot. I have incompatible shoes with the rug.

219
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,100
- 天啊 - 对不起
- God. - I'm so sorry.

220
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,160
关于Meyer总统 我们没多少好消息
We don't have a lot of good news for President Meyer.

221
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:39,320
去他妈的 这一晚就是
Screw this whole sloppy,

222
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,580
乱七八糟的后座吹箫之夜 老娘不管了
backseat blowjob of a night anyway. I don't give a shit.

223
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,360
- 等等 - 怎么了?
- Hang on. - Hang on what?

224
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,360
威斯康辛的结果被撤回了
The Wisconsin call has been rescinded.

225
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,700
你是说又回到待定状态了？
You mean they went back on the call?

226
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,370
是的 所以我说他们撤回了结果
Yes, hence my saying that they had.

227
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,000
撤回这个词其实不能让人马上理解
Rescinded is actually not a word that's immediately clear.

228
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,870
- 这简直是360度大逆转啊 - 是180度
- This is a 360-degree turn. -  It's 180.

229
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,630
撤回现在是我最喜欢的词!
Rescinded is my new favorite word!

230
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,930
我们又有戏唱了 死后复生
We are back in the game. Back from the dead.

231
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,220
僵尸们 决胜局开始了
Zombies, bottom of the ninth.

232
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,300
夫人 听着
Ma'am, listen to this.

233
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,890
福克斯台宣布科罗拉多是你的了(9票)
Fox just called Colorado for you.

234
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,220
- 不是吧 - 哦 天啊
- No! - Oh, my God!

235
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,890
都往后退 Meyer已经势不可挡了
Stand back, Meyer is on fire.

236
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:17,450
快看 妈妈 CNN也宣布了
Look, look. Mom, CNN has it, too.

237
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,400
看起来Matty的多明诺骨牌又站回原位了
It appears that Matty's domino is standing up straight again.

238
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,280
很显然这非常出人意料
Obviously this is a shock

239
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,070
- 需要仔细分析 - 是啊
- and needs some unpacking. - Mm-hmm.

240
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,820
哦 是啊 你是得好好分析分析
Oh, yeah, you better unpack it.

241
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,960
"来看看现在我们能不能分析这东西"
"Let's see if we can unpack this now."

242
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,210
"哦 我头上长了阴毛"
"Oh, I've got pubic hair on my head."

243
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,880
模型的准确性取决于你输入的数据
The models are only as good as the data that you put into them

244
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,130
而数据来自民意调查公司
and the data comes from the polling companies.

245
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,170
所以也许我们应该问问他们什么地方出问题了
So maybe we should talk to them about what went wrong.

246
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,550
- 你的网站就是一坨屎 - 真心是屎啊
- Your website is shit. - Honest to God. Shit.

- you fucking moonfaced hobbit. - Yeah.

249
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:47,840
夫人 我们能单独聊聊吗?
You know, ma'am, can we talk privately?

250
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,510
哦 当然 好啊
Oh, sure, yeah.

251
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,430
我觉得我对这次竞选
I'd like to think that I have been

252
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,480
- 起到了一些作用 - 你做的很棒
- some use to the campaign. - You've been great.

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,820
是的 我们帮他们游说过
Yep, we lobbied for them,

283
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,440
所以我的手被辣椒粉公司的钱弄脏了
so my hands are dirty with paprika money.

284
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,910
我会向他们提起你有多棒的
I'll mention how good you are to them.

285
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,530
不需要 他们知道的
No need, they already know.

286
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,280
对啊
That's right.

287
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,700
不分上下 难分胜负 不分呀宝贝呀 不分伯仲 难以置信 还难分胜负呢
Too close to call. Too close to call. It’s too close baby yeah. Too close to call. It’s unbelievable. It’s still too close to call

288
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,210
据我所知 想去嫖的雏儿都没现在这种纠结的情况
I've known sailors less likely to go either way than this.

289
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,540
抱歉... 说了黄段子
I... pardon my ribaldry.

290
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,050
- 伊利诺斯还是我们的 是吗?(20票) - 是的
- Hey, Illinois is still ours, isn't it? - Yes.

291
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:50,720
- 爱荷华州选择了O'Brien(4票) - 去他妈的爱荷华
- And lowa called for O'Brien. - Fuck lowa.

292
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,130
我想用核武器平了它 不过我觉得已经有人炸过了
I'd say nuke it, but I think someone already did.

293
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:55,890
宾夕法尼亚州难分胜负(20) 弗罗里达州势均力敌(29)
Pennsylvania's too close to call. Florida's too close to call.

294
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,190
你可以总结总体趋势
You might gather the general trend

295
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,110
就是势均力敌 难分胜负
is that it's too close to call.

296
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,730
国会的结果也一样势均力敌
The congressional results are similarly tight.

297
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,900
你不用摇那个袋子 好吗?
Okay, you don't need to shake that bag, all right?

298
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,820
试着闭上嘴嚼 看看行不行
Try chewing with your mouth closed. See if that works.

299
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,790
好了 他们说我们将在大约一小时后
All right, they're saying we're gonna get a clearer picture

300
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:12,370
对整体情况有更清楚的了解
of this whole thing in about an hour.

301
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,040
老天 我好紧张
God, I am so tense.

302
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,320
我的屁股都能夹碎核桃了
I could crack a walnut in my ass.

303
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,630
- 好了 妈 跟我来 - 什么?
- Right, Mom, come with me. - What?

304
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,750
等情况明了了再回来
Just get out of here until this picture becomes clearer.

305
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,000
- 来点亲子时间好吗? - 好吧
- Maybe have some mother-daughter time? - Okay.

306
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,700

对男性健康运动的支持
the men's health campaign

314
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:49,020
让我能够告诉男人们他们应该爱抚自己
and letting me tell guys that they should feel themselves up.

315
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,910
持续的变化

316
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,160
这是我做过的最简单的工作
Easiest job I ever had.

317
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,370
大家记得我的... 大家记得我的口号 对吗?
You guys remember my... you guys remember my catchphrase, right?

318
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,080
记得吗? 使劲想想
Remember it? Just to jog your memory.

319
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,290
要记得 经常检查 不要疏忽
Just remember, check'em, don't neglect 'em.

320
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,790
经常检查 不要疏忽
Check 'em, don't neglect 'em.

321
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:07,790
很好 大家记得A-Team (83年电视剧) 对吗?
Nice. You guys remember the A-Team, right?

322
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:11,260
A-Team? "我是A-Team"
A-Team? "I'm the A-Team."

323
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,850
T先生 嗯...
Mr. T. Um...

324
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,600
他们本该逃跑的
they were supposed to be on the run,

325
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
但是 你知道 他们在一个很特别的面包车里
but, you know, they were in a really distinctive van.

326
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:23,020
是啊 那是... 那是怎么回事?
Yeah, what was up... What was up with that?

327
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,610
感觉有点入禅的感觉 你知道吗?
Feeling kind of zen-ish, you know?

328
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,150
我意识到没有什么我能做的了
I realize that there's nothing more I can do.

329
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,570
事情已经脱离了我的控制
Things are out of my control

330
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,450
我必须抛弃紧张情绪
and I just have to let the tension go.

331
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,990
滚开 Kent
Get the fuck out of here, Kent.

332
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,660
抱歉
Apologies.

333
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,630
你和Jason 我很遗憾
I'm sorry about you and Jason.

334
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,550
我知道我的工作让你有些困难
I know that my job can be hard on you

335
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,000
这实在有点扫兴 是吗?
and that was a bit of a bummer, huh?

336
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:49,130
- 是的 有一点点 - 是的
- Yeah, just a little bit. - Yeah.

337
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,670
但是就像你说的 我不能和一个说客结婚 所以...
But like you said, I can't be married to a lobbyist, so...

338
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,010
是的 而且他得有60了吧
Yeah, and he was, like, 60.

339
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,260
- 他35 - 他接受的如何?
- He was 35. - How did he take it?

340
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,180
很难说 他感情不易波动
It's hard to tell. He's not really big on emotions.

341
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,010
嗯哼
Mm-hmm.

342
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,520
你知道吗 Catherine
You know, Catherine,

343
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,070
男人都糟透了
men are horrible.

344
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,660
好吗?
Okay?

345
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,110
我是说 我不得不
I mean, I have to just

346
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,940
这样告诉你 甜心
tell it to you like it is, honey.

347
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:19,530
所有男人都可恶极了
But all men are awful.

348
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:20,670
真的
Really.

349
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,840
重点只是找到一个
And the key is to just find a man

350
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,700
最不那么糟糕的男人
who's the least horrible.

351
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,590
好的 妈妈
Okay, Mom.

352
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,840
看 你和我的照片
Oh, look at that photo of you and me.

353
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,880
- 你在那张照片里很像我 - 不像
- You look like me in that picture. - No.

354
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,300
不像 一点不像
No, uh-uh. Not at all.

355
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,220
- 像 有一点... - 不像
- Yeah, a little bit... - No, uh-uh.

356
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,970
- 哦 - 哦 这是爸爸
- Oh. - Oh, there's Daddy.

357
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,270
- 糟透了 - 妈
- Horrible. - Mom.

358
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,810
好了 我回来了 我走了多久?
Okay, I'm back. How long was I gone?

359
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:50,030
- 大概20分钟 - 真的吗?
- About 20 minutes. - Is that it?

360
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,360
老天 和Catherine在一起时间总是感觉如此漫长
God, it always seems longer with Catherine.

361
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,650
好吧 我的命运如何了?
All right, so what's my destiny here?

362
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,150
仍然不可预测
Still unfathomable.

363
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,040
为什么美国人民如此优柔寡断?
Why can't the American people make up their minds?

364
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,740
我说 两个候选人选一个有多难?
I mean, how hard is it to decide between two candidates?

365
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,910
去他妈的
Oh, for fuck's sake.

366
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,490
- Amy - 嗨 Sue
- Amy. - Hey, Sue.

367
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,830
- Amy 很高兴见到你 - 你好
- Amy, nice to see you. - Hi. Mmm.

368
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,170
我得在Karen的嘴和我的耳朵之间找点空间
I've got to get a little space between Karen's mouth and my ears.

369
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,830
我要去买点汽水 大家要什么吗?
I'm gonna hit the soda machine. Anybody want anything?

370
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,390
放了真糖的东西
Just something with real sugar.

371
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,750
不要甜味剂 否则我就要拉裤子了(甜味剂吃多了腹泻)
No sweeteners or I'll shit my pants.

372
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:18,560
- 欢迎回来 - 谢谢
- Welcome back. - Thank you.

373
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:25,350
- 您好 夫人 - 哦 哇哦
- Hello, ma'am. - Oh, wow.

374
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,480
电视上的Amy Brookheimer
TV's Amy Brookheimer.

375
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,430
我感觉我应该在这里 夫人
I felt that I needed to be here, ma'am.

376
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:32,770
我们一起经历了那么多才让您走到这里 所以...
We went through so much together getting you here, so...

377
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:35,690
宾夕法尼亚的结果马上要出来了 他们正准备宣布
Pennsylvania results are about to come in. They're about to call this.

378
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,440
所以那个怎么... - 嘘
So how is it... - Shh.

379
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,110
宾夕法尼亚预测投给O'Brien(20票)
Pennsylvania called for O'Brien.

380
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,280
哦 不可能!
Oh, no way!

381
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,000
- 我早就说我们应该到那去拉票 - 你是对的
- I said we should have gone back there. - And you were right.

382
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:47,290
- 你当时为啥要辞职? - 很难说
- Why did you ever resign? - It's hard to understand.

383
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,620
我认为宾夕法尼亚州是今晚真正有着重大意义的投票
I think Pennsylvania is the real significant call tonight.

384
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:53,170
宾夕法尼亚 Matty 你认为Meyer会赢下它 对吗?
Pennsylvania, you had that as a Meyer win, is that right, Matty?

385
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,880
对 呃... 是的
Yeah, uh... yes.

386
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:57,760
这个 呃... 是这么认为的
That's, um... Yes, we did.

387
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,550
不能总是料事如神 是吧?
Can't predict everything all the time, can you?

388
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,270
尽管这是你的本职工作
Even though that is your job.

389
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,100
Dan 这是Meyer总统生涯的结束吗?
Is this the end for President Meyer, Dan?

390
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,140
如果总统这么快就考虑打给O'Brien议员认输
Well, I would not be surprised if the president were thinking

391
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:09,270
我不会感到惊讶的
about calling Senator O'Brien very soon to concede this election.

392
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,640
专家们知道个屁?
What do experts know?

393
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,560
O'Brien267票 我们207票
Got O'Brien 267, us 207.

394
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:17,200
如果这是真的 貌似他要赢下选举了
If those are right, it looks like he's got the election.

395
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,620
这些都只是预测 不是真正的结果
These are projections. These are not real results.

396
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,240
只是捕风捉影
They're ghosts.

397
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,960
你不能... 你不能认输
You can't... you can't concede.

398
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,130
我知道你想认输 但你真的 真的不应该这样
I know you want to, but you really, really shouldn't.

399
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,660
或者...
Or...

400
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,660
咋了?
What?

401
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,300
我要认输了
I'm gonna concede.

402
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,050
我 呃...
I, Uh...

403
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,010
我觉得这么拖下去没什么意义
I don't see any point in dragging this on.

404
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:44,310
我希望我输也要输的有尊严
And I'd like to have a little bit of dignity in defeat.

405
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,510
所以 呃...
So, um...

406
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,680
我要给O'Brien打电话
I'm gonna call O'Brien.

407
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:52,850
反正这傻逼工作也不咋地
This fucking job sucks anyway.

408
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:56,570
请千万别电死我
Please don't electrocute me.

409
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,420
接下来是总统和您讲话
The next voice you hear will be the president.

410
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,710
- Bill - 多美好的夜晚啊 夫人
- Bill. - A fascinating night, ma'am.

411
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,600
总统女士 给我打电话有什么特别原因吗?
Were you calling me for a particular reason, Madam President?

412
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,050
首先我要感谢你
I wanted to just start by thanking you

413
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:27,550
领导了一项庄重的...
for conducting a very dignified...

414
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,050
- Ben
- Ben.

415
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:31,020
是 Mike Selina在认输
Yeah, Mike, Selina's conceding,

416
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,310
所以 别弄汽水了 来箱威士忌
so forget about the soda and just grab a crate of whiskey.

417
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,860
妈的
Fuck.

418
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,040
- 我知道了
-  I know.

419
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,240
是时候把上吊绳变成领带了 哥们
Time to turn that noose back into a necktie, buddy.

420
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,570
我有你想听的消息
I got something you're gonna want to hear.

421
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,490
Dan 你告诉我的都没有屁用
Dan, there's nothing useful you can tell me.

422
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,410
宾夕法尼亚投票结果搞错了
Pennsylvania was the wrong call.

423
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,710
我们认为Selina要赢了
We think it's gonna go Selina.

424
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,160
听着 我不知道怎么...
Look, I have no idea how...

425
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,300
不! 不要! 不要！别认输!
No! Don't! Don't! Stop the concession!

426
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,720
所以 Bill 我觉得是时候该告诉你
So, Bill, I feel now is the time to call you

427
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:03,050
- 呃... - 女士 不要 不不不

Um, also another thing I'd like to just mention...

429
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,340
呃 你过得怎么样?
Uh, how's it going?

430
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,760
过得怎么样?
How's it going?

431
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,430
只有咱俩
You and I are the only ones

432
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,760
经历着相同的事情
sort of going through the same thing

433
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,930
我只是...
and I just...

434
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,820
夫人 恕我直言
Ma'am, forgive me for being direct,

435
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:18,440
可你不是要认输的么?
but you're not conceding?

436
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,160
不 我不知道什么
Um, no. I don't know why

437
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,280
让你认为我要认输 Bill
you would even imagine that I would be doing that, Bill.

438
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,610
赢下宾夕法尼亚的是Selina
people of Pennsylvania go to Selina Meyer.

439
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:29,200
是啊 我不知道你看见了没 Bill
Yeah, I don't know if you've seen this, Bill,

440
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,870
不过他们好像宣布宾夕法尼亚投给我了
but they seem to have called Pennsylvania for me.

441
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,670
是 我听到了
Yes, I heard that.

442
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,120
我好奇你现在是不是
I wonder if there's anything that you

443
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,510
有什么想和我说的
would like to say to me right now.

444
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:42,010
我会入主白宫 把热澡盆给我准备好
I'm taking the White House. Please leave the hot tub on.

445
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,960
我不这么认为 亲爱的朋友
I don't think so, my friend.

446
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,300
凌晨 1：30

447
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,300
巴尔的摩Meyer James竞选集会

448
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,300
先生 人群越来越焦躁 乐队也停止演奏了
Sir, the crowd is getting restless. The band has stopped playing.

449
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,690
我已经黔驴技穷不知道怎么办了
I've given them my best material and we don't know what to do.

450
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,110
我们需要给他们来一剂政治兴奋剂
We need to give them a hit of political meth.

451
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,560
我觉得我们应该派Tom去
I think we should send out Tom James.

452
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,440
呃 女士 你介意让Tom去
Uh, ma'am, would you consider allowing Tom

453
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,150
竞选集会台上吗?
to go out on the rally stage?

454
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:05,980
什么? 呃 这个 我看看 首先 不行
What? Uh, well, let's see. First of all, no.

455
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,450
其次我还是非常想说的是
And then the other thing I really wanted to say

456
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:11,120
不行
was no.

457
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,040
我听见了个不行
I'm hearing a no.

458
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,960
Jonah 不好意思 答案是...
Jonah, sorry, the answer is...

459
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,630
哦 天噜
Oh, hello.

460
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,830
- 怎么了? - 我的个老天爷的七舅老爷
- What? - Holy mother of moly.

461
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,080

- They called Ohio. - Oh, my God, that's amazing!

464
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,590
俄亥俄? - 不 是O'Brien拿下了 我该说清楚
Ohio? - No, for O'Brien. I should have said.

465
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,930
- 哦 天啊 - ABC电视台说这实在是势均力敌 难分高下
- Oh, my God. - ABC is saying it's still too close to call.

466
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:36,100
- 是啊 - 不 他们正在宣布...  O'Brien赢了
- Yeah. - No, they're calling it now... O'Brien.

467
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,320
- 妈蛋! - 还是福克斯还有政客新闻网
- Shit! - Fox again and Politico.

468
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:40,230
宣布新罕布什尔和俄亥俄投给O'Brien
New Hampshire to O'Brien and Ohio.

469
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,350
- 太好了 我们拿下了佛罗里达! - 哦!

470
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,190
- 太牛逼了 - 是啊
- That is extraordinary. - Yes.

471
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,160
- Kent 我现在票数多少? - 好的 等一下
- What is my number now, Kent? - Okay, one second.

472
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,910
你是2.. 你是... - 多少?
You're two... You're... - What?

473
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:51,410
- 查到了 您的票数是256 - Kent 现在情况怎么样?
- Yeah, you're 256. - Kent, where does that leave us?

474
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,200
好的 现在就看弗吉尼亚州的选票了
Okay, it all comes down to Virginia.

475
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,500
如果O'Brien在弗吉尼亚州胜出  他就赢定了
If O'Brien gets Virginia, he wins.

476
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,840
- 但是 如果我们在弗吉尼亚州胜出... - 我们就赢定了!
- However, if we get Virginia... - We win!

477
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,170
不 其实  Gary 就算我们赢得了弗吉尼亚 我们也是正好打个平局
No, actually, Gary, if we get it, we tie.

478
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,120
- 啥? - 什么啥?
- What? - What?

479
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,530
虽然我没目不转睛的盯着选票数据
I don't follow these things that closely,

480
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,840
但就是这样 对吧 Davison先生?
but that's right, isn't it, Mr. Davison?

481
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,090
是的
Yes.

482
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:10,130
平局 居然是平局? 你确定 我们是平局?
Tie, like it's a tie? You mean, we tie?

483
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,180
- 确实是  - Greg 但最出人意料的  是这件事的影响
- You do. - The real shock, Greg, is where this leaves us.

484
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,550
如果总统夫人拿下弗吉尼亚州 两位候选人就是齐头并进
Neck and neck if the president takes Virginia.

485
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,610
Matty 不好意思这次我要略过你了
Matty, you'll forgive me if I sideline you here.

486
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,940
- 没问题- Dan 你了解总统
- Sure. - Dan, you know the president well.

487
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,030
此时此刻 Meyer酒店套间里的人到底在干嘛呢?
What is going on in that Meyer hotel suite right this second?

488
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,280
总统的智囊团有很多专家在为选举奔波
The president has a lot of top minds working on her campaign.

489
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,480
他们现在肯定全在忙活这事
They're gonna be all over this.

490
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:30,070
如果打成平局会怎么样?
What happens when there's a tie?

491
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,200
所有人都在上网
Everybody goes online to

492
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,240
搜索 想搞明白我们平局后该怎么办
try to find out what happens if we get a tie.

493
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,410
我动作比你快多了 靠 我搜的是如何打领带(tie同有平局和领带意思)
Way ahead of you. Shit, I'm just getting how to tie a tie.

494
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,830
有相关的书吗?  就那种老式的... 纸质的书?
Is there a book? Like an old-fashioned... like a paper book?

495
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,880
我的天呐 知道吗?
Jesus Christ, you know?

496
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,960
就算你竭尽全力 想为人民服务
You do your best. You try to serve the people

497
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,970
- 可是那些人人却把你操个人仰马翻 - 是啊
- and then they just fuck you over. - Yeah.

498
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,720
你知道这是为什么? 因为他们愚昧无知
And you know why? Because they're ignorant

499
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,420
他们蠢到粪坑里
and they're dumb as shit.

500
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,760
而女士们先生们 这 就是民主
And that, ladies and gentlemen, is democracy.

501
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,180
- 该死的玩意儿 - 第十二修正案
- God damn it. - It's the 12th Amendment.

502
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,100
- 我查到第二十修正案 - 怎么这么多修正案?
- I have 20th Amendment. - Why are there so many amendments?

503
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,650
一次性搞清楚行么  同志们
Get it right the first time, people.

504
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,770
其实两个都对  第十二修正案被第二十修正案取代了
It's actually both. 12th is superseded by the 20th.

505
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:06,690
他们允许白宫在一月二十日之前进行总统选举
They give the House until January 20th to elect the president.

506
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,120
每个州一张选票
Each state gets one vote.

507
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,440
第一个得到26张选票的候选人即为新总统
First candidate to 26 is the new president

508
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,280
然后由参议院选出副总统
and the Senate chooses the VP.

509
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:13,440
这种选举难分胜负
It's a close election

510
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,780
很多众议院都难分胜负势均力敌
with a ton of House races too close to call.

511
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,280
如果众议院选举结果还是平局呢?
What happens if it's a tie in the House?

512
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,170
对啊   - 跳舞决胜负吗?
Right. - Is it a dance-off?

513
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
这样的话 副总统候选人将会成为总统
Well, vice president-elect becomes president.

514
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,450
参议院选谁做副总统 谁就能当总统
Whoever the Senate has picked for VP will be president.

515
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,370
- 等等  这样的话...   - 那Tom...
- Wait, that means... - That Tom...

516
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,430
什么? - 可能会成为总统
What? - Could be the president.

517
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,300
呃 我...
Well, I...

518
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,460
我还不清楚这是怎么回事
I had literally no idea.

519
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,520
不过做好准备总没错
It's good to be prepared.

520
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,640
这样 等等 你的意思是我...
So, wait. So you mean that I...

521
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,060
我他妈的要输给我他娘自己的副总统?
I might lose this election to my fucking vice president?

522
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,400
至少总统是从我们团队出来的 夫人
At least it'd be somebody from our team, ma'am.

523
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,530
我是说 这也是好事 对吧?
I mean, that's good, right?

524
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,650
我可没想惹她哭
I didn't mean to make her cry.

525
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,160
- 没事 没事
- There, there.

526
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,500
哦 一切都会好的
Oh, it's gonna be okay.

527
00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:09,830
- 她要倒下了  - 她要倒下了
- She's going down. - She's going down.

528
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,800
别碰她
Don't touch her.

529
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,680
- 喂?   - 先生 很抱歉直接联系您
- Yeah? - Sir, I'm sorry to contact you directly,

530
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,180
但是现场的人们个个垂涎欲滴的样子要见您
but the crowd is drooling for you.

531
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,010
是啊 地板都被口水弄湿了
Yep, floor is wet out here.

532
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:24,730
- 好的 太好了 谢谢 - Tom James! Tom James!
- Okay, great. Thank you. - Tom James! Tom James!

533
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,770
我去会场振奋一下士气
I'm gonna go rally the rally.

534
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,350
恕我直言
With all due respect,

535
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:32,190
你现在必须振作起来 女士
you need to get your shit together now, lady.

536
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,360
硬气点 你还是这个自由国度的元首
Ma'am up. You're still the leader of the free world.

537
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,750
嗯?
Hmm?

538
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,120
Tom去哪了?
Where's Tom?

539
00:22:41,170 --> 00:22:44,120
噢  他去会场为大家讲话去了
Oh, he's gone to talk to the crowd at the rally.

540
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,340
- 什么? - 他妈的他想干什么
- What? - The fuck he has.

541
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,790
你怎么能允许他这么干?
Why would you let him do that?

542
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,590
- 哦 你又不在这工作  - 你也不属于这
- Well, you don't work here. - Well, neither do you.

543
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:52,760
好好 去他妈的 我要去会场
All right, fuck all of you. I'm going to the rally.

544
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,930
夫人 夫人  这史无前例
Ma'am, ma'am, that would be unprecedented.

545
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,380
没有 我告诉你什么叫史无前例 Kent
No, I'll tell you what's unprecedented, Kent.

546
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:59,800
平局是史无前例
A tie is unprecedented.

547
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:02,100
成为首位女性总统也是史无前例
So is becoming the first lady president.

548
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:06,470
那个想走捷径当总统的王八蛋也是史无前例
So is that jackoff becoming president through the back door.

549
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,890
知道了吧? 现在已经没有规则了
Okay? The rule book's been torn up now

550
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,860
这个国家已经把一切规则都擦了屁股了
and America is wiping its nasty ass with it.

551
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,900
别他妈挡着我!
Get the fuck out of my way!

552
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,620
- 夫人! 夫人!  - 我们走
- Ma'am! Ma'am! - Let's go.

553
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:23,410
Tom James! Tom James!
Tom James! Tom James!

554
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,630
Tom James!
Tom James!

555
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,470
谢谢
Thank you.

556
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,670
好吧 我承认 这有点意思
Okay, I admit, this isn't boring.

557
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,390
为什么总选票数会一模一样?
Why make the total of electoral votes an even number?

558
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:40,760
- 神经错乱? - 我知道 今夜很漫长
- Insanity? - Listen, I know this is a long night.

559
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,760
你们又冷又累 腿都站疼了
You're tired and you're cold and your legs ache

560
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,930
还很想去洗手间
and you need the bathroom.

561
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:47,100
哎呀 你们肯定内急得很了

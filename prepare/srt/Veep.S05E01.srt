1
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:18,650
副总统
第五季 第一集

2
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,530
选举翌日

3
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,540
上午 9:04

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,340
我亲爱的美国同胞们
My fellow Americans,

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,900
今晨我以对我们至上的民主政体
I stand before you this morning in barefaced awe

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,660
校对:苹果酒
监制:Jereau 苹果酒
压制:天天

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,890
无比敬畏之心站在你们面前
of the majesty of our democratic system.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,520
多么神奇的夜晚
What a night.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,260
在我们这样的民主国家
In a democracy such as ours,

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,170
靠其公民选出其总统
it falls to the people to choose their president,

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,620
这也是你们昨晚所经历的
and that is what you attempted to do last night.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:42,720
而结果却是 在总统选举团中
As it turned out, there's a virtually unprecedented tie

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,140
存在前所未有的平局
in the electoral college,

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,060
许多学者都认为选举平局
a somewhat arcane institution

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,480
这样罕见晦涩的情况早该被废除
that many scholars believe we should do away with.

16
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,810
内华达 拉夫洛克市政厅

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,820
人口 1947

18
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,070
而我个人想要表达的是
I wish to say on a personal note

19
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,070
尽管当下存在平局
that although there is a tie,

20
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,400
我也十分荣幸能取得众多票数
I am most privileged to have won the popular vote.

21
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,830
尽管这僵局令人沮丧泄气
And though this tie may be frustrating,

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,390
我向美国人民保证
I want to assure the American people

23
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,440
我们国家绝不会群龙无首
our country is not leaderless.

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,880
不管你支持谁 我现在仍是你们的总统
No matter who you voted for, I am your president.

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,550
谢谢你们 上帝保佑你们
Thank you all. God bless you.

26
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:13,600
也惟愿上帝保佑美利坚合众国
And may God bless the United States of America.

27
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,940
结束
We're clear.

28
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,760
下面我们谈吧? 演讲真棒
Can we have the room? Fantastic speech, ma'am.

29
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,150
三个重点 坚定 稳定 还有镇定地胡说
The three Ss-- strength, stability and bullshit.

30
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,840
我忘记感谢选民让我们国家
Yeah, I forgot to thank the voters for

31
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:25,120
看上去像高中里的西班牙社团
making our country look like a high school Spanish club.

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:28,480
那些操蛋的国父们不知道什么叫奇数吗?
Didn't those founding fuckers ever hear of an odd number?

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
希腊社会给我们的两大贡献...
Two great Greek contributions to society...

34
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,310
民主还有花式操蛋
democracy and getting fucked up the ass.

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,280
这俩我还都试过 言过其实 就像爵士
I've tried both and they're way overrated, like jazz.

36
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,610
我保龄球教练曾说打平局就像亲了你妹一样
My bowling coach used to say a tie was like kissing your sister.

37
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,760
这感觉就像我妹在我胸上拉了坨屎
Well, this feels like my sister took a shit on my chest.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,180
我天 我也告诉你啊
God, I'll tell you something, too, okay?

39
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,200
打死我也不要给那个骄傲自大 迪克·凡·戴克
There is no world in which I am going to be vice president

40
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,160
一样的操蛋汤姆·詹姆斯做副总统
to that smug, Dick Van Dyke-looking motherfucker Tom James.

41
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,470
见鬼了他妈的他以为是谁...
Who in the hell does he think...

42
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,330
凯瑟琳你拿着那东西在干吗啊?
Catherine, what are you doing with that thing?

43
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,650
- 开着吗? - 还记得我们做完回去的时候吗?
- Is that on? - Remember when we got back last night?

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,410
这是我的论文电影 关于这个平局
My thesis film about the tie.

45
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,790
她是瓦萨大学电影专业的
She majored in film at Vassar College.

46
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,340
相信我 我知道她学什么
Oh, believe me, I know what she majored in.

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,980
每年花六万五千刀看电影
65 grand a year to watch movies.

48
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,170
妈 这绝对是历史性事件
Mom, this is such a historic event.

49
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,850
你能行行好离我远点吗?
Can you please just get off of me?

50
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,010
那我永远不会弄出我导师喜欢的课题了
And I never came up with a thesis my advisor liked

51
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,260
因为我上半学年有过
because I had that thing

52
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,880
全程把我累的不要不要的...
last semester where I was tired all the time...

53
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,530
好的 我们没时间听你叨叨你的症状
Okay, we don't have time to hear the story of your syndrome.

54
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,710
你的辅修呢 舞蹈?
What about your minor, dance?

55
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,540
你怎么不为我这选举
Why don't you make up a

56
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:23,040
编一支舞呢?
little kind of a dance about the election?

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,360
也是课题啊 比如说你在
You know, you can't decide

58
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:26,220
你该不该跳舞中挣扎
should you dance or should you not dance?

59
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,960
你得严肃看待这事儿 你保证过我的
I want you to take this seriously. You promised me.

60
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,500
行行好 凯瑟琳 别发牢骚了 好嘛?
Please, Catherine, stop with the whining, all right?

61
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,920
你都快把这儿的防弹玻璃震碎了
You're gonna shatter the bulletproof glass in here.

62
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:36,280
我们没拿下特拉华州是什么鬼?
How is it that we did not win Delaware?

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,590
所以你的回答是 是?
Okay, is that a yes to my question?

64
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,600
好的吧 她享有完全通行权 可以吗?
Okay, she can have full access, okay?

65
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,450
在我们讨论完也门问题之后
Starting right after we address the situation in Yemen.

66
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,520
亲爱的 也门
Honey, it's Yemen.

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,700
当生活给你也门 你得榨成也门汁
Life gives you Yemen, you got to make Yemenade.

68
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,830
好吧 我等会再来
Okay, well, I'll come back later.

69
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,950
反正你也会回来的
You always do.

70
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,480
女士
Ma'am.

71
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,300
不 电影没戏
No, there's not gonna be a film.

72
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,000
凯瑟琳做成的唯一一件事
The only thing Catherine ever finished

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,370
就是消灭一整块冰淇淋蛋糕
was an entire ice cream cake.

74
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,180
也门这个借口想得快准狠 不错
Quick thinking about Yemen, by the way.

75
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,640
事实上 四名基督教传教士被烧至死
Actually, four Christian missionaries burned to death.

76
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,410
更好了
Oh, even better.

77
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,180
艾米! 上帝啊
Amy! Jesus.

78
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,580
我这边脸上的这东西感觉像是狗的乳头
This thing on the side of my face feels like a dog nipple.

79
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,070
很难发现的 女士
It's hardly noticeable, ma'am,

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,910
就像我们我们西班牙选民投票结果
like our Hispanic voter turnout.

81
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,530
我估计你得去看看医生了
Maybe you just might want to see a doctor just in case.

82
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,920
不 她不需要医生 一切尽在掌握
No, she doesn't need a doctor. I got it under control.

83
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,100
- 艾米! - 哈?
- Amy! - Yeah?

84
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,760
- 所以怎样? - 没啥
- So, what? - Nothing.

85
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:27,340
我整晚都在
I've been on the phone all night with these clueless

86
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,690
和我们这些无能的宪法律师专家通话
constitutional law experts of ours.

87
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,180
我都不知道怎么让他们"硬"一点
I don't know what's getting their dicks harder,

88
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,260
选举平局还是和一个女孩谈话
an electoral college tie or talking to a girl.

89
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,620
- 你回来了吗? - 不 我就是来帮个忙
- Are you back? - No, I'm not back. I'm just helping out.

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,870
- 女士 - 又咋了?
- Ma'am. - What?

91
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,580
你想就你那个看看医生吗...
Do you want to see a doctor about the...

92
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,090
- 是个压力痘痘 - 不 它是
- It's a stress pimple. - No, it's

93
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:45,020
- 我屁股上老长 - 不是压力痘痘
- I get them on my ass all the time. - It's not a stress pimple.

94
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,920
只是一个普通痘痘长在了压力比较大的时候
It's a pimple that erupted during a very stressful time.

95
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,520
- 盖瑞已经在处理了 好嘛? - 绝对 好
- Gary's on it, okay? - Exactly, yes.

96
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,310
- 我没有勺子 - 啊
- I don't have a spoon. - Oh.

97
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,120
你试过苹果醋吗?
Have you tried cider vinegar?

98
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,500
没 我们用热敷就够了
No, we're using hot compresses. That's all we need.

99
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:56,720
治压力疙瘩? 本屁股上也有
For the stress pimple? Ben

100
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,480
她得看医生了
gets those on his butt. She should see a doctor.

101
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,900
- 艾米回来了 - 不 我还没回
- Amy's back. - No, I'm not back.

102
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,510
- 演讲的反响棒呆了 - 好
- Ma'am, rave reviews on the speech. - Good.

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,890
- 还有个大新闻 - 上帝啊 奥布莱恩陈词了?
- Oh, and big news. - Oh, God, O'Brien made a statement?

104
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,740
对不起 我应该说这是私人大新闻的
I'm sorry, I should have said big personal news.

105
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,250
温蒂和我要从中国领养一个宝宝啦
Wendy and I are adopting a baby from China.

106
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,150
我们原本准备在选举之后再公布的
We were keeping it a secret till after the election.

107
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,500
好吧说实话 温蒂也才是今天刚刚告诉我
Actually, Wendy was keeping it a secret from me until today

108
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:17,000
因为我藏不住秘密
because I'm so bad with keeping secrets.

109
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,710
- 但我要晋升为人父啦 - 你就一傻逼
- But I'm gonna be a dad. - You're a nincompoop.

110
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:22,970
我们处在选举平局的中艰阶段
We are in the middle of a tied election.

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,640
可没啥时间给什么中国宝宝
There is no time for some Chinese baby.

112
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,460
宝宝退了吧 看你能不能把钱要回来
Cancel it and see if you can get your money back.

113
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:31,600
幸运的曲奇说你搞砸了 小圆眼
Fortune cookie say you fuck up big-time, round eye.

114
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,930
没啥大不了 我都不知道宝宝什么时候回来
It's not a big deal. I don't even know when to expect her.

115
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,390
今天开始 我得练就一身父亲的体形了
And, starting today, I'm getting in dad shape.

116
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,000
- 数我的步伐 - 真可惜你没细数你失足的步伐
- Counting my steps. - Too bad you're not counting your missteps.

117
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,230
你早餐时就可以解决了 是吧?
You'd be done by breakfast, right?

118
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:43,040
我还是喜欢在脑海中数
I prefer to count my steps in my head.

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,580
4383步
4,383.

120
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,440
滚出我视野 肯特 好嘛?
Get out of my sight, Kent, okay?

121
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,990
就这破平局我还没原谅你呢
I have not forgiven you for this tie.

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,660
女士 我这有众议院最终的结果
Ma'am, I have the final House results.

123
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,420
- 拉封丹赢了? - 嗯
- Lafontaine won? - Mm-hmm.

124
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,450
一个反对堕胎的人得让他的
How many abortions does a pro-lifer

125
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,250
情妇堕胎几次才能让人们都去痛恨他?
have to pressure his mistress into before the people turn on him?

126
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,670
- 3次 - 克雷格是怎么输的?
- Three. - And how did Craig lose?

127
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,350
她不是去过印第安纳州五次吗?
Didn't she go to Indiana, like, five times?

128
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:05,760
那估计就是问题所在了
That may have been the problem.

129
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,890
好的吧 听着 从现在开始
All right, listen. From this moment forward,

130
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,520
众议院拉票是关键
people, I am all about the House vote.

131
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,280
我们建议单独约
We are recommending direct

132
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,000
国会议员见面
engagement with individual congressmen.

133
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:16,510
- 就这么说定了 - 就这样
- That's got to happen. - That's right.

134
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:18,810
而且每天你们都得做奥布莱恩做不了的事
And every day you have to do the one thing O'Brien can't do.

135
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,840
- 对 像是不喝酒开车 - 还有拉屎时没有疝气
- Yeah, drive sober. - Take a shit without getting a hernia.

136
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,350
是做个总统 当务之急是
Be the president. It is imperative

137
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,460
你得看上去像个总统
that you look presidential right now.

138
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,680
我要去拜访军队
I'm going to visit troops,

139
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:32,030
上下空军一号越多越好
go on and off of Air Force One as much as possible.

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,260
- 我们都不必离开地面 - 对
- We don't even have to leave the ground. - Right.

141
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,080
女士 你可能得考虑
Ma'am, you may want to consider

142
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,600
举办那个关于种族的研讨会了
moving up that symposium on race.

143
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,910
我并不觉得我们得这么快开那个操蛋的研讨会
I don't think that we're symposium on race desperate yet.

144
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
- 懂我的意思? - 嗨
- All right? - Hi.

145
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:44,620
不好意思我迟了
Sorry I'm late.

146
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
太奇怪了 我竟然同意艾米刚刚说的每句话
Strangely, I agree with everything Amy just said.

147
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,360
我也推荐
And if I may also suggest

148
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,170
重新利用选举的推特账户
repurposing the election Twitter account

149
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,800
创建一个总统账户和美国群众直接对话
to a new POTUS account to talk directly to the American people.

150
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:58,030
好主意 比尔 你能不能...
Great idea, Bill. Could you...

151
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,170
你能不能暂时先出去下?
could you step outside for a moment, please?

152
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,810
好
Sure.

153
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,480
能比你出现在罗斯福房间
There's only one person

154
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,960
更让我惊讶的就只有他妈的泰迪·罗斯福
I'd be more surprised to see today in the Roosevelt Room

155
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,610
自己的鬼魂出现在这了 你来干嘛
and that's Teddy fucking Roosevelt.

156
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,720
我只是想帮帮总统
I'm just trying to help the president.

157
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,030
她心领了
And she appreciates that.

158
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,230
但是哥伦比亚特区的检察长
But the US Attorney for the

159
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,160
正准备起诉你
District of Columbia is prepared to indict you.

160
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,250
你在这的受欢迎程度就像在犹太人教堂里的一坨纳粹形状的屎
You're as welcome here as a swastika-shaped shit in a synagogue.

161
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:23,930
- 当然 - 我和总统谈过
- Of course. - I spoke with the president

162
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,120
她愿意考虑完全的原谅
and she's willing to reconsider a full pardon

163
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,080
如果你悄悄投降 没有媒体报道
if you surrender quietly. No media.

164
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,600
只是别想支配新闻圈
Just don't want to dominate the news cycle.

165
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,700
- 我能说件事吗? - 好嘞 再见
- Can I just say one thing? - Yes, good-bye.

166
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,930
所以 这事咋样?
So, how'd it go?

167
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,150
他像一个男人一样接受了
He took it like a man.

168
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,390
哇 他最好习惯 啐
Oh, well, he better get used to that. Pfft.

169
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,520
她多可爱呀?
Isn't she adorable?

170
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,960
- 我看他们都长一样 - 什么?
- Oh, they all look alike to me. - What?

171
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,640
不是中国人 是小孩的图片 多大了?
Not Chinese people, but pictures of children. How old?

172
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:55,260
中介说她要么十六个月要么三岁
The agency says she's either 16 months or three years old.

173
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,830
- 你喜欢你的健康腕带吗? - 当然
- Do you like your Fitbit? - Oh, yeah.

174
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,900
对 我今天已经超过一万两千步了呢
I am just over 12,000 steps today.

175
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,160
我只有三千 你跑来上班的嘛?
I'm at 3,000. Did you run to work today?

176
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,320
不 工作让我一直活跃着
No, the job keeps me active.

177
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:06,490
总统办公室
Office of the president.

178
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:08,810
请稍等
Hold, please.

179
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,460
稍后回来的是 民意调查员事后析误
When we come back, the pollster postmortem.

180
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,690
总统选举打平 载入史书

181
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,610
为什么出口民调如此差强人意?
Why were the exit polls so off?

182
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,380
- 喔 格雷格 - 丹
- Oh, Greg. Greg. - Dan.

183
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,280
- 昨晚干得漂亮 - 谢谢
- Great job last night. - Thank you.

184
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,220
我看见 马蒂·柯蒂斯 在停车场哭了
I saw Matty Curtis crying in the parking garage.

185
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,600
不可思议 嘿
That's fantastic. Hey, listen.

186
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,920
我很期待能重新回来 但是他们一直让我等着
I was really hoping to get back on, but they got me waiting

187
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,840
- 在休息室 大概两个小时了 - 斯博迪来了
- in the greenroom for, like, two hours. - Spauldy showed up.

188
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,880
他在这了 他正在做头发 还是回家吧 我觉得
He's here. He's getting his hair done. Just go home, I guess.

189
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,130
但是我昨晚上通杀了呀 对不对?
But I killed it last night, right?

190
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,080
丹 我觉得你在这会有不错的发展
Dan, look, I think you could have a future in this,

191
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,560
但是你必须走出去给自己赚点名气
but you got to get out there and make a name for yourself.

192
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,110
你负责了两周的竞选 然后精神崩溃了
You ran one campaign for two weeks and had a nervous breakdown.

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,600
医学上这么说是不准确的
That is medically inaccurate.

194
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,530
出去赢个信基督恐同的同性恋
Go out, win a race with a Jesus-loving

195
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,640
或者是什么种族歧视的亿万富翁
homophobic homosexual or a racist billionaire.

196
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,820
然后我们再来说说你的职业生涯
Then we can talk about a career in TV.

197
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:55,820
- 痘巨人看起来怎么样? - 生气 你挤它了吗?
- How's Zitzilla looking? - Angry. You been picking at it?

198
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:56,570
没有
No.

199
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,190
稍微挤了一下 但是...
Ahem, well, maybe a little bit, but...

200
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,180
- 哇! 天呐 - 上帝啊 怎么了? 怎么了?
- Ow! Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. What? What?

201
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,140
- 操这也太热了 - 本来就应该热的
- Oh, that is so hot. - It's supposed to be hot.

202
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,790
而且茶是凉的
And the tea is cold.

203
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,110
总统女士 今晨
Madam President, Chinese hackers

204
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,820
中国的黑客们突破了国家安全局的防火墙
breached an NSA firewall earlier this morning.

205
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,910
- 黑客有没有顺手修好WiFi? - 我查一下
- Any chance they fixed the Wi-Fi? - I'll check.

206
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,340
联邦情报局的负责人正在等着见你
And the director of the Secret Service is waiting to see you.

207
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,200
让他进来 如果他在等着见我 还能怎样...
Then send him in. If he's been waiting to see me, I mean...

208
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,270
- 嗨 基斯 - 很抱歉打扰你 女士
- Hi, Keith. - Sorry to bother you, ma'am.

209
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,710
没有 谈不上打扰
No, it's okay. It's no bother.

210
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,440
自从你成为了总统 我们一直在
Since you became president, we have

211
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,480
寻找一个新的领头特工负责你的安保细节
been looking for a new lead agent for your detail.

212
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,420
我挺喜欢鲍勃的啊 除了那颗褪色的牙
Gosh, I like Bob. I mean, apart from the discolored tooth.

213
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,360
但这明显不是一个换掉他的理由啊
But that's obviously not a reason to replace him.

214
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,760
- 他们能把那颗牙换掉吗? -不能
- Can they replace the tooth? - No, no.

215
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,420
女士 这位是特殊探员 马乔里·帕尔苗蒂
Ma'am, this is Special Agent Marjorie Palmiotti.

216
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,040
- 你好 - 你好 女士
- Oh, hello. - Hello, ma'am.

217
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,080
- 是探员? - 帕尔苗蒂

218
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,280
- 帕尔苗蒂 欢迎加入 - 谢谢您
- Palmiotti, okay. Welcome aboard. - Thank you.

219
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,170
女士 成为领头特工的一个关键要素就是
Ma'am, a key requirement for being lead agent

220
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,180
要看起来像总统 尤其是从背后看起来
is someone who looks like the president, especially from behind,

221
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,080
向任何潜在刺客提供

我完美的匹配你的背影
I'm a perfect match from behind.

I am not quite seeing it,

226
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,430
只因为我很…
um, only because I'm...

227
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,040
然而 你...
well, you are...

228
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,490
- 女士? - 就是... 你介不介意给我们一点时间
- Ma'am? - It's just... would you mind just giving us a second,

229
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,610
特工 帕尔... 谢谢你
Agent Palmi... thank you.

230
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,960
基斯 你真的看不出来吗?
Keith, are you really not seeing what it is I'm seeing?

231
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,280
- 看不出来 女士  - 盖瑞 你来说?

她闻起来完全不一样 所以 你懂得...
She smells completely different, so, you know...

233
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,950
我不是说这个... 不是...
That is not what... t's not...

234
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,520
不好意思 女士 如果你... 对不起
Excuse me, ma'am, if you... I’m sorry.

235
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,890
- 什么? - 你必须看看这个 女士
- What? - You've got to see this, ma'am.

236
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,670
- 很高兴见到你   - 很高兴见到你  女士
- Pleasure to meet you. - Pleasure to meet you, ma'am.

237
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,370
我去
Oh, shit.

238
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,180
此刻的重大新闻... 内华达州
The big story at this moment... Nevada.

239
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,090
所有的选票已经记录
With all the votes now tallied,

240
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,510
总统选举团全部打平

241
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:46,510
总统职位待定

242
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:45,310
议员比尔·奥布莱恩赶超了总统赛琳娜·梅耶
Senator Bill O'Brien's lead over President Selina Meyer

243
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,830
不足百分之零点五 根据内华达州法律
is now less than half a percent, which by Nevada state law

244
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,810
重新计数极其有可能发生
would allow for a possible recount.

245
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:56,210
内华达重算或让梅耶当选

246
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,440
如果总统梅耶 可以在重新投票中胜出
If President Meyer were to win a recount,

247
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,710
她就会赢得内华达的六次投票选举
she wins Nevada's six electoral votes

248
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,660
也就赢得了总统席位
and therefore the presidency.

249
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,880
- 所有的网站都在说这个  - 《纽约时报》也是
- All the networks have it. - "New York Times" As well.

250
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,220

wait a minute. Is this really happening?

257
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,170
我是说 我们真的在内花达重新有一次机会?
I mean, do we actually have a chance at Nevada?

258
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,720
- 是内华达 - 天呐
- "Nev-add-a." - Oh, my God.

259
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,310
我可以当总统啦 我不用搬家啦 我们要做什么?
I get to be president. I don't have to move. What do we do?

女士 我们需要百分百确定当我们到了...
Ma'am, we need to be sure that when we get on…

262
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,820
不 闭嘴肯特 你已经让我在内花达输过一次了
No, shut up, Kent. You already lost Nevada for me once.

263
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,260
- "内华达." - 本我们要怎么做?
- "Nev-add-a." - Ben, what do we do?

264
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,020
我们需要稳住那些内华达已有的支持者 别 别
Uh, we need to get ahold of our people in Nevada. Don't. Don't.

265
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,540
大部分内华达的投票是通过机器
The vast majority of Nevada voting is done by machine.

266
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,940
一旦内华达的州政府公证了那些投票
Once the Nevada Secretary of State certifies the count,

267
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,850
我们就会有72个小时来申请一个重新计数
we'll then have 72 hours to request a recount.

268
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,600
在那个时候 会选出5%的范围
At that point, 5% of the precincts will be selected,

269
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,320
如果此范围的误差高于1%
and if there's a discrepancy of more than 1%,

270
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,580
就可以申请一个全面的重新投票
a full hand recount will be requested.

271
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,070
我的博士学位研究的就是在西部的重新计数选举程序
I actually did my doctorate in recount procedures in the West.

272
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,420
一级棒理查德 理查德现在为我工作
Excellent work, Richard. Richard works for me.

273
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,910
- 你有个博士学位? - 两个
- You have a doctorate? - Two.

274
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,210
宪法和兽医
Constitutional law and veterinary medicine,

275
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,560
- 这是我的后备计划 - 但你之前是给我倒咖啡的
- which was my fallback. - But you were getting my coffee.

276
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,090
这个更难 因为你有很多不同的心情
Which is much harder 'cause you have so many different moods.

277
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
比如一半咖啡和全杯咖啡 黑糖玛基朵
Like a half-caff and a full-caff, macchiato.

278
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,740
- "玛奇朵." - 玛奇朵
- "Ma-key-ato." - Macchiato.

279
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,380
好啦 理查德 你来做我的重数特派员
Okay, Richard, you are going to be my recount specialist.

280
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,550

- Jonah, you're working for Richard. - Wait, what?

281
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,570
艾米 你把这些事情都理个清楚 好吗?
Amy, you got to sort all of this out, okay?

282
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,770
女士 我不能去内华达 我都不能说我真在这里
Ma'am, I really can't go to Nevada. I'm not even really here.

283
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,000
女士 奥布莱恩要在一个小时内
Ma'am, O'Brien is calling a

284
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,340
举办一场新闻发布会讨论关于重新计数的事情
press conference in an hour to discuss the recount.

285
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,080
我会在半小时内发表讲话 好吗?
I'm gonna talk in a half an hour, okay?

286
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:10,910
我要在他说屁话之前先说话
I got to say stuff before he says stuff.

287
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,360
- 听着 你要去写点什么 - 我现在就去
- Listen, you got to write something up. - I'm on it.

288
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:15,820
马上 重数 重数
Right now. Ooh, recount, recount.

289
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,230
乔纳 跟着我 谢谢
Jonah, with me, please.

290
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:21,310
这简直是超级无敌大狗屎
This is highly enriched weapons-grade bullshit.

291
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,610
她怎么敢让你领导我?
How dare she put you in charge of me?

292
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,170
这就是货真价实的暴行
It's an outrage is what it is.

293
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,920
这就是暴行 你知道吗?
It is an outrage, you know?

294
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,080
她就像是 德斯礼舅舅 然后她有一个
She's Uncle Dursley and she's got

295
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,750
厉害的哈利波特藏在楼梯里
the great wizard Harry Potter living under the staircase.

296
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,460
你看到了吗? 但是哈利波特书里到底发生了什么?
Do you see that? But what happens in the Harry Potter books?

297
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,070
他崛起了然后杀了所有的麻瓜
He rises up and he kills all the muggles.

298
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,060
不是这样的
I don't think that's what happens.

299
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,980
事实上 很抱歉 那个腰撑是这个椅子的
Actually, I'm sorry, that lumbar support goes with this chair.

300
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,270
- 对 我们马上就到 - 好的 你写了什么?
- Yeah, we're getting there. - Okay, so what do you got?

301
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,530
我是否仍然厚颜无耻的
Am I still standing in barefaced

302
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,560
敬畏着我们的民主制度?
awe of the majesty of our democratic system?

303
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:52,940
- 不完全 女士 这次
- Not exactly, ma'am. This time

304
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,350
- 抱歉 - 什么?
- Oh, sorry. - What?

305
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,540
成功走满5000步的提醒
Just hit 5,000 steps on my Fitbit.

306
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,160
- 好吧 好吧 - 这次 你就是简单地备受眷顾
- Okay, okay. - This time, you're simply blessed.

307
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,920
哇 我还以为你的上一篇是华丽空洞的废话呢
Wow, I thought your last one was flowery, vacuous nonsense.

308
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,460
这一个更糟了 做得好 迈克
This one is much worse. Excellent, Mike.

309
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,740
盖瑞 盖个痘痘的时间我都能
Gary, this is taking longer than it did

310
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,760
- 装修完一栋房子了 - 我们必须走起了
- for them to paint my fucking pool house. - We got to go.

311
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,880
- 下午好 - 下午好
- Good afternoon. - Good afternoon.

312
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,880
人满为患啊
Yes, oh, wow. Look at this full house.

313
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:19,560
当我想到我们伟大的国家的时候
When I think about this great country of ours,

314
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:22,110
我不得不细数我的幸运
I have to count my blessings.

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,860
今日早些 正如你们记得的那样
Earlier today as you'll remember,

316
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,170
梅耶总统第二次发表全国性讲话

317
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,650
我对于事态的发展做了简短的报告...
I briefed you on the state of affairs regarding...

318
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,700
看起来更糟了
It's looking a little worse.

319
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,720
不管你站在这个屋子的哪里
Wherever you stand in the room,

320
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,950
它都一直盯着你
it's still looking at you.

321
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,230
从那时起 我们在内华达新发展就像是
Since that time, we have been doubly blessed

322
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,120
被双倍的眷顾了
by new developments in the state of Nevada.

323
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,540
而且我很自信...
And I am confident...

324
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,300
- ...所有的美国民众
- ...that all Americans,

325
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,240
包括奥布莱恩议员...
including Senator O'Brien...

326
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:48,420
- 别管它 别管它 - 加油
- Leave it. Leave it. - Come on.

327
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,560
这是我作为总统义不容辞的义务
It is my clear duty as president

328
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,100
来加强贯彻这个国家的法律
to enforce the laws of this country

329
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,840
在小心评估了
after a careful assessment

330
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,910
各项法律真正的意义的前提下
of what those laws actually mean.

331
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:03,920
- 能成为你们的总统候选人是我的幸运
- I am also blessed to be your candidate for president.

332
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,990
- 这是什么? - 痘痘破了? 破了吗?
- What is this? - Did it pop? Did it pop?

333
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,860
道琼斯指数比我夏天的蛋蛋还要低
The Dow is dropping lower than my balls on a hot summer day.

334
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,490
因选举不确定性 股票大量抛售

335
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,030
尽管美国人民有些时候会...
While the American people may sometimes be...

336
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,320
都是那个该死的痘痘
It's the fucking pimple.

337
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,460
痘巨人刚刚卷席了华尔街
Zitzilla just stomped all over Wall Street.

338
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:21,570
于此而言  我们都是被祝福的
And in that, we are all blessed.

339
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:23,630
谢谢你们
Thank you.

340
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,760
那么 怎么样?
So, how was that?

341
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,720
道琼斯指数下降了986...
The Dow has dropped 986...

342
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,460
日你妹啊
Oh, suck my dick.

343
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,740
二次计票造成的恐慌导致了证券大跌
Panic from the recount led to a huge sell-off

344
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:42,020
市场已经被过度下注了
and the market is so overmargined, blammo.

345
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,810
道琼斯指数自2008年以来降到最低

346
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,930
他们已经开始说是黑色星期三了
They're already calling it Black Wednesday.

347
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,780
天呐 今天才星期三吗?
Jesus, it's only Wednesday?

348
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,070
而且奥布莱恩 刚刚发布了一项声明
And O'Brien just issued a statement.

349
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,810
他说 "市场的崩溃
He says, "The market crash

350
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,160
是美国的脸上的一个污点"
caused a blotch on the face of America."

351
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,540
那说我的痘痘吗?
Is that about my pimple?

352
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,970
周二选举被华尔街黑色星期三盖过风头

353
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,260
反正痘痘也没帮啥忙
Well, I don't think it helped.

354
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,630
- 盖瑞  - 嗯?
- Gary. - Yeah?

355
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:03,050
- 我想要看医生 -好的 我只是觉得没必要...
- I want to see a doctor. - Okay, I just don't think...

356
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,980
是你造成的 那些热敷让它长更大了
You did this, okay? All that heat made it grow bigger.

357
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,780
你在我脸上烤了个舒芙蕾饼
You baked a fucking souffle on my face.

358
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,220
总统阁下 一切痘好吗?
Madam President. Howzit going?

359
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,780
他是不是刚说了 痘?
Did he just say zit?

360
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,570
为什么从没有人暗杀过副总统呢?
How come no one ever tries to assassinate a vice president?

361
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,520
接下来 我们要在经济方面采取什么举措?
Okay, so what are we going to do about the economy?

362
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,960
我们何不从任命一位经济专家开始呢?
Why don't we appoint an economy

363
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,160
至少像那么回事
czar for a start? That seems like something.

364
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:26,970
就好比把一辆空的警车停在
Like an empty cop car they

365
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,570
马路对面 让来往的司机都减减速那样子
park on the side of the road to slow speeders.

366
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:29,820
那些警车里都没人?
Those cars are empty?

367
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,300
- 行了 你给我坐下 - 是的 夫人
- Okay, you've got to sit down. - Yes, ma'am.

368
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,980
同志们 是时候把种族研讨会提上议程了
Guys, it might be time to move up the symposium on race.

369
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,900
我在跟进了 夫人 兢兢业业的
I'm on it, ma'am, like brown on rice.

370
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,020
夫人 汤姆·詹姆斯刚在该死的
Ma'am, Tom James just gave

371
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,510
《坦荡君子》上接受了采访
an interview to the Bumfuck "Plain Dealer"

372
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:44,840
我引用一下他的原话
where he says, and I quote,

373
00:14:45,130 --> 00:14:46,880
"我只想确认一下他们是否在重算
"I just want to make sure they're recounting

374
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,220
所有海外现役军人的
all the absentee ballots of

375
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,760
缺席选票"
our men and women bravely serving overseas."

376
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,670
- 联合通讯社也是这么写的 - 他在干嘛?
- It's up on AP, too. - What is he doing?

377
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,260
他明明知道军队不待见我
He knows that the military hates me.

378
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,440
反正肯定会给奥布莱恩拉来更多选票
There are only bound to be more votes for O'Brien.

379
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:58,560
而我们需要你的票多点 他的票少点 女士
We need less of those and more votes for you, ma'am.

380
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:00,270
有道理啊?
You think?

381
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,390
错了 我们要做的是给他们敲一遍警钟
No, what we have to do is hang a bell on this guy.

382
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,700
他太不按规矩来了
He's completely off book.

383
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,770
不是的 夫人 我觉得他只是在熟悉他的台词而已
No, ma'am, I think that means that he's learned all his lines

384
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,970
都快滚瓜烂熟了
and he no longer needs a script.

385
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,800
- 不 他的行为出轨了 - 出柜?
- No, he's off book. - Off the hook?

386
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:17,760
不是 他... 天 他讲的话偏离了
No, he's... God, he's deviating from the book

387
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:19,240
原本的轨道
of the things that he should do.

388
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,580
- 噢你说脱轨了 - 噢
- You mean off the rails. - Oh.

389
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,240
好吧 他的行为脱轨了
Fine, he's off the rails.

390
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,060
那么 让汤姆来当经济专家好了
Well, let's make Tom economy czar.

391
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,520
可以有
Yeah.

392
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,300
我们让他专门干这活 这会让他忙疯的
We'll czar him. That'll give him something to do.

393
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,250
好 我们就从这个开始
All right, we're gonna start with that.

394
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,070
艾米 我想跟你谈谈
Amy, Amy, I just need to talk to you for one second.

395
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,710
我有个很严肃的问题
I've got a very big question.

396
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,760
我不能去内华达 我很抱歉
I can't go to Nevada. I'm sorry.

397
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,380
我考虑这个问题考虑了很久 真的
I have thought about this a lot.

398
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,600
你觉得凯蒂·卡罗索
What do you think of Candi Caruso

399
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,440
帮我管理内华达事务怎么样?
to head up Nevada for me?

400
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,140
好啊
Oh, yeah.

401
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,320
我听说她相当能干
I hear just excellent things about her.

402
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,190
- 负责过哈佛法律周刊 - 没错
- "Harvard Law Review." - Right.

403
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:52,940
她给坦尼法官当过书记员
She clerked for Justice Tenny.

404
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,820
- 30岁以下的30个最佳政客 - 是的
- "Politico"'s 30 under 30. - That's right.

405
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,650
她现在还不到30岁 她看起来显老 但是...
She's still under 30. She looks older, but...

406
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,610
- 你觉得她不错吧? - 当然
- You like her? Yeah. - Yes.

407
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,700
我的意思是 如果你需要一个超级能干
I mean, if you want a super smart woman

408
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,030
还年轻貌美睿智无比的女人 那干嘛不选她?
who's young and brilliant, then why not?

409
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,220
对啊 我就是这么想的
Yeah, I really want that.

410
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,580
真的
I really do.

411
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,550
听着 除去那些重新核对的选票
Look, regardless of the recount,

412
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,910
西德尼·珀塞尔办公室

413
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,920
下午 1:20

414
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,380
这对小西葫芦来说还是一件大喜事
this could mean big things for zucchini.

415
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,630
嗯 好 我们迟点再说 拜
Yeah, good. We'll talk later. Bye.

416
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,060
丹尼男孩 昨晚在电视上看到你了
Hey, Danny boy. Saw you on TV last night.

417
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,130
- 讲得不错 - 不敢当啊
- Nicely done. - Yeah. Thank you.

418
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,020
不过我的确想跟你说这档子事
That's actually what I wanted to talk to you about.

419

- 我被炒了? - 对的 请出去

我们给奥布莱恩加注了大筹码
We are doubling down on O'Brien,

431

所以你现在跟路边40岁大妈一样没用
so you're basically as useless to me as a 40-year-old woman.

00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:50,930

458
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,030
为什么呢? 你可以接手处理经济危机了

00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,460
不 我会因经济危机而受到责难的
No, I would be blamed for the economic crisis.

460
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,620
汤姆 得了吧 你想当财政部长

461
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,160
不记得了吗? 我不觉得这跟财政部长有什么不同
Remember? I don't see how this is any different than that.

462
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,910
恕我直言 总统夫人 我希望您能分清两者
Well, respectfully, Madam President, I hope you do

463
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,800
如果连美国总统
because if the President of the United States

464
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,170
都不能区分财政部长跟
can't tell the difference between Treasury Secretary

465
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,900
管证券市场的受气包 那就很尴尬了
and stock market patsy, that's pretty disturbing.

466
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,180
那你接受吗?
Then you accept?

467
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:24,680
总统夫人 我十分荣幸
Madam President, it is a huge honor,

468
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,980
但我必须权衡自己的所想所作所为 我敬谢不敏
but I have to balance that against my need not to do it.

469
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,600
汤姆 我在以美利坚合众国
Tom, I'm asking you

470
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:33,850
总统的身份请求你
as the President of the United States.

471
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,700
而我 毕恭毕敬地 拒绝
And, respectfully, I am declining.

472
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,380
我并没感觉到尊敬啊
I'm not picking up any respect.

473
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,130
但是感觉到我拒绝了吧?
But you're getting the declining?

474
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,060
你知道凯蒂·卡罗索的真名是什么吗?
Do you know what Candi Caruso's real name is?

475
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:51,340
是坎迪斯 她把名字改成了糖果 只不过后面是I而已
It's Candice. And she changed it to Candi with an I.

476
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,900
如果她都能把自己名字改成这鬼样
If she does that to her own goddamn name,

477
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,790
谁能担保她把那些重新计算的选票改成什么样?
how the hell is she going to handle a potential recount?

478
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,010
早上好 艾米 这是总统的日程表

I hear you, but this is a family recipe from my aunts in Savannah

他们坚称能根治皮肤病跟偏头痛
and they swear by it for skin problems and migraines.

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,130
- 然后呢 - 鹰嘴豆作底料 加点塔巴斯科辣酱油 搅拌...

你这样说让我觉得很饿
All you're doing right now is making me hungry.

Amy, did you need me for anything?

490
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:24,560
- 没有 我就在这待一会 - 没有? 那好

嗨 我是I字结尾的Candi
Hi, it's Candi with an I.

498
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,060
我是Y字结尾的Amy 这才是正确的拼法
Amy with a Y. Which is correct.

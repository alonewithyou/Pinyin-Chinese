我们先说清规则 根据内华达州法律

115
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,630
如果重新计票样本结果出现了1%或以上的不一致

116
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,890
也就是这次的512票

我们将要对整个州的投票进行重新计数

目前 大部分都是远程在线投票
Now, most of the voting here is touch screen,

119
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,340
所以我们要做到也仅仅是整理所有的投票结果
so we can't do more than retabulate those totals.

120
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,190
但是你能重数选民认证的书面审计索引
Except you could recount the voter-verified paper audit trails.

the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled in Crowley v. Nevada

124
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,060
这样就不用重新计数
that you don't have to recount

125
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,570
当地的书面审计索引了
the paper audit trails in local elections.

126
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:52,070
- 是克拉利对内华达? - 是克劳利

或者你发邮件给我也行 我邮箱是splett2@splettnet.Net.
Or you could email me at splett2@splettnet.Net.

Splett1 is my father. It'll be sad to see him go,

130
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,260
但如果能把那个地址归我也蛮好的 你觉得呢
but it'll be nice to get my hands on that handle, you know?

梅耶尔是不是输不起啊?

133
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:08,130
我并没有听到你们所有的问题
I didn't quite catch all your questions.

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,340
- 我们在里面碰了个大钉子 - 我们得走了
- We had a pretty big setback in there. - We have to go.

135
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,440

你刚刚那简直是给他们了一本时代生活指导手册
You just gave them a Time

139
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,960
专门教他们怎么搞死我们
Life instrction manual on how to fuck us.

140
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,120
你们本来有迈克尔·乔丹在这儿随时恭候
You guys have Michael Jordan sitting on the bench here,

141
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,950
可是非去捧哈基姆·奥拉朱旺
but you're starting Hakeem Olajutwat.

142
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,620
你才不是什么迈克尔·乔丹
You are not Michael Jordan.

143
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,960
你就是个得了马凡式综合征还要死不死的
You are a seven-foot-seven goony-looking Lithuanian

144
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,380
傻大个儿呆逼酒鬼
who's gonna drop dead of Marfan syndrome.

145
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:29,460
快他妈给我滚上车
Get your ass in the car.

146
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,900
- 雄鹰到来了[引用76年《猛鹰雄风》电影名] - 是的他来了
- The Eagle's landed. -  Yes, he has.

147
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,520
- 总统女士 - 您说?
- Madam President. - Yes?

148
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,520
为您服务我深感荣幸
This is truly an honor to serve you.

149
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:37,540
好的 真是非常感谢
Well, thank you very much.

150
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,060
况且我绝不会错过
Plus I would never miss the opportunity

151
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,060
花式爆詹姆斯·惠特曼菊花的机会
to dry fuck Jim Whitman up the ass.

152
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,700
凯瑟琳 出去
Catherine, out.

153
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,930
鲍勃我得给你介绍下艾米·布鲁克海默
Oh, Bob, I need to introduce you to Amy Brookheimer

154
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,580
她的团队目前就在内华达
and her team in Nevada right here.

155
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,490
很高兴见到你 布拉德利先生
Nice to meet you, Mr. Bradley.

156
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,930
在卡森市你手上有多少个律师?
How many lawyers you got on the ground in Carson City?

157
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,010
- 我想大概...
- I believe it's roughly...

158
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,790
明天之前把那个数量翻一倍
I want you to double it by the end of the day.

159
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,380
现在 我们来说说重新计票这事
Now, let's talk about the actual recount.

160
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,430
我发现件关于邮寄选票的有意思的事儿
Well, I noticed something funny about the mail-in ballots.

161
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,720
好的 说来听听 平权杰克森[美国一重金属乐队]
All right, let's hear it, Affirmative Action Jackson.

162
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,250
奈县的书记官
Well, the county clerk of Nye

163
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,580
因为签名和选民名单不符
County disqualified a huge number of mail-in ballots

164
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,360
把大量邮件投票计为无效
because the signatures didn't match the voter rolls,

165
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,250
我去查了 发现他是奥布莱恩那派的筹款人
so I checked and he's an O'Brien fundraiser.

166
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,780
他肯定这样作废了大量支持梅耶的选票
He probably chucked out a ton of Meyer votes.

167
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,160
你怎么没去调查这事 金发妞
Why aren't you moving on this, blondie?

168
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,690
对啊 艾米 长点脑子 我的老天
Right, Amy. Come on, get it together. My God in heaven.

169
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,820
我们立刻就去 总统女士 先生
We will get right on it, ma'am, sir.

170
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,130
鲍勃 你怎么看? 你觉得我们能胜出吗?
Bob, what do you think? Are we gonna win this thing?

171
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,910
我是说 你真实的想法
I mean, really honestly, your true gut.

172
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:30,090
总统女士 我可有很大的信心(巨大的蛋)
Well, Madam President, I've got big balls,

173
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,690
- 而且保证绝对不是虚的 - 真讨厌
- but neither one of them are crystal. - Oh, darn it.

174
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,380
这让我想起尼克松那个屌人在
This reminds me of something that Dick Nixon used to say

175
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:37,800
打算把美国拉出越南那个泥潭的时候
to Henry Kissinger back when that tricky son of a bitch

176
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:40,800
冲亨利·基辛格说的话了
was trying to get us out of that messy business called Vietnam.

177
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:43,940
- 是的 越南 - 他会说 "亨利 你个小婊砸
- Vietnam, right. - He would say, "Henry, you son of a bitch.

178
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,530
师傅领进门之类的我能办到 喂奶我可管不了啊."
I can lead a horse to water, but I can't milk it."

179
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,280
不会喂奶! 我都不知道你在说什么
Can't milk it! I don't even know what that means.

180
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,200
- 但我喜欢 - 我还有一堆电话要打
- I love it. - I've got to make a million phone calls.

181
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,980
- 请允许我失陪一下了 - 没问题
- So you'll have to excuse me. - All right.

182
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,120
- 大家再见 - 再见 太棒了 就是他了
- Good-bye, everyone. - Good-bye. Fantastic. We got our guy.

183
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,770
- 嗨 鲍勃 - 嗯?
- Hey, Bob. - Yeah?

184
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,070
你肯定不记得我了 我是当初那个实习生 在你还是...
You don't remember me. I was an intern way back when you were...

185
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,200
我当然记得你
Of course I remember you.

186
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,800
快瞅瞅 本·卡弗蒂长大了
Lookie here. Ben Cafferty all grown up.

187
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,340
我们原来给这小伙子起了无数个绰号
We used to have a million nicknames for this guy.

188
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,610
我们叫他舔屌胖仔
We called him Fatty Dicksuckle

189
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,540
还有什么笨尼 精爷
and B-B-Benny and the Jizz.

190
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,270
操后门的
Buttfucker.

191
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,050
操后门的 对就是我
Buttfucker, that's me.

192
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,750
不敢相信你都记得我的绰号
I can't believe you remembered my nickname.

193
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,510
看到你太高兴了 非常开心
Good to see you. Nice to see you.

194
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,460
亲爱的老苏 你还在这呢
Oh, good old Sue. You're still here.

195
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,910
- 天啊 天啊 - 还在这?
- My, oh, my. - Still here?

196
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,880
上世纪80年代后他就不在白宫工作了
He hasn't worked in the White House since the late '80s.

197
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,530
苏到底多大啊?
How old is Sue?

198
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,260
内华达选举委员会

199
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,270
需512票可全州重新计数

200
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,530
那一票肯定是投给梅耶的
Well, that's clearly a vote for Meyer.

201
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,290
这写着她名字呢 这是个补名选票
It says her name right there. It's a write-in.

202
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,030
上面写的是 “操赛琳娜·梅耶 "
It says "Fuck Selina Meyer."

203
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:43,980
怎么说这票该算是我们的
If anything, that one should count for us.

204
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,220
这个算无效
Move to call this a no vote.

205
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,390
别 看到了吗
No, no, no. See, right there.

206
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:49,500
这有个逗号
See that? Yeah, that's a comma.

207
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,380
- 哪里? - 在 "操" 后面有个逗号
- Where? - After fuck, that is a comma.

208
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,860
所以它意思不是 "操赛琳娜·梅耶尔"
So it doesn't say "Fuck Selina Meyer."

209
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,250
应该是 "操! 赛琳娜·梅耶尔!"
It says, you know, "Fuck, Selina Meyer!"

210
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
这正是这个选民对梅耶总统
That's a testament to this voter's earthy

211
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,580
质朴却日月可鉴的热情和支持的证明啊
but unambiguous enthusiasm for President Meyer.

212
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,130
绝对是的
Absolutely.

213
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:07,940
- 那这票算梅耶 - 好! 太棒了!
- Vote for Meyer. - Yes! Yeah.

214
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,380
- 总统女士 - 你好 经济专家先生
- Madam President. - Yes, Mr. Economy Czar.

215
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,710

欢迎来到您的金融特遣小组
Welcome to your banking task force.

- Great idea of yours. - Yeah, it is, isn't it?

219
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:18,940
我正期待着
I'm looking forward to

220
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,570
什么时候能听见我第二个奇思妙想呢?
hearing what my next great idea is gonna be.

221
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,110
我很高兴看到您把我的政策会谈
Oh, I'm glad that you're able to turn

222
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,870
变成一场毫无意义的拍照秀
my actual policy meeting into a meaningless photo op.

223
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,540
就咱们说话这会儿 我敢肯定道琼斯指数正直冲云霄
I'm sure the Dow is rocketing skywards as we speak.

224
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,970
你不用去个什么志愿者早午餐之类的吗?
Don't you have a volunteers brunch or something to get to?

225
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,400
- 我觉得你要过去啊 - 是啊
- I think you do. - Hmm, yeah.

226
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,390
而且我告诉过你
And I have to tell you,

227
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,390
看那些人吃饭真得很让人享受
it is a pleasure to watch those people eat.

228
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:38,950
- 失陪了 总统女士 - 放松点
- Madam President. - Yeah, take it easy.

229
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,490
- 哎呀我天 我知道 - 哎呀我天
- Wow. I know. - Wow.

230
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,490
鞋子挺牛逼啊 老板
Boss boots, boss.

231
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,370
谢谢 纯鳄鱼皮的
Oh, thanks. Yeah, check those out. Genuine crocodile skin.

232
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,610
对啊 我穿上这玩意儿放倒克林特·伊斯特伍德
Yeah, I'm gonna be pulling down Clint Eastwood

233
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,560
那些牛仔电影里的娘娘腔都不成问题
cowboy movie style pussy in these things.

234
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,100
只不过我不是无名之人
Except I'm not the man with no name.

235
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,490
我是个各路吊炸天之人
I'm the man with mo' game.

236
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,300
下午好先生 您的投票被取消了
Afternoon, sir. We're here because your ballot

237
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,330
因为您的签名不符合...
was disqualified because your signature didn't match...

238
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,650
好吧 把我当傻子耍了
okay, well, fooled me with that one.

239
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,540
- 咱们团队合作的不错 - 干得漂亮 理查德
- Good job, team. - Yeah, nice job, Richard.

240
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,650
如果我是领导的话肯定不会这么做
That's not how I would've done it if I was in charge.

241
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,630
那你怎么做
How would you have done it?

242
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,070
我不能教你怎么做
I can't teach how I do it.

243
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,960
你说保罗·麦卡特尼能教会摇滚小子怎么写歌吗
Can Paul McCartney teach Kid Rock how to be a good songwriter?

244
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,900
当然 这个例子不恰当 摇滚小子最强 但是...
I mean, that's a bad example. Kid Rock rules, but...

245
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,800
女士 这是查理·贝尔德 韦瑞特公司首席执行官
Hey, ma'am, this is Charlie Baird, CEO of EM Wheelright.

我以为会花上两个小时
I thought this was going to be two hours

250
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,200
来听汤姆·詹姆斯提醒我们收入太高了
of Tom James lecturing us about being paid too much.

251
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,790
汤姆有时是 要是我能说...
Well, Tom can be, dare I say...

252
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,270
有点傻逼?
A bit of an asshat?

253
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,600
其实我是想说 他是中产阶级的代表
Actually, I was gonna say a champion for the middle class,

254
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,920
但是诚实点 我好像更喜欢你的说法
but I kind of like your thing better to tell you the truth.

255
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,270
女士 这位是菲利普·瑞安 他是
Ma'am, this is Phillip Ryan. He's the

256
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,920
- 你能先等一下嘛  - 当然
- Can you hang on just two seconds? - Of course.

257
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,510
问你个事
So let me ask you this.

258
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,570
市场到底出了什么问题
What in the heck is going on with the markets?

259
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,280
- 不知道 - 好吧
- I don't know. - Oh, great.

260

我猜那是你们
Yeah, I think that's what

263
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,890
捐给我对手的钱 对吧
all of you donated to my opponent, right?

264
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,120
坦白地说 我也为你的选举捐钱了
Full disclosure, I did donate to your campaign as well.

265
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,240
两千吗
Two grand?

266
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,520
你从哪找到这笔钱的 你的沙发缝里
Where'd you find that? In your sofa seat cushion?

267
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,480
好像在我另外一条裤子口袋里 总统女士
I think it was in my other pants, Madam President.

268
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,610
- 很好 欢迎你的到来  - 女士
- Good. Nice to have you here. - Hey, ma'am.

00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,010
- 苏珊还好吗  - 他离婚了
- Yes, how is Susan? - He's divorced.

272
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,290
她这么对你 都没进监狱
Not in jail for what she did to you.

273
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,010
真的太过分了 但是很高兴在这里见到你
Honestly, it is an outrage. But I'm happy you're here.

274
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,090
我们要开始这个会议了 对吧
And I think we've got to get this meeting going, don't we?

275
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,640

Oh, thank you very much. Oh, Jesus Christ.

278
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,450
不用担心伊莱
Don't worry about Eli.

279
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,620
布克兄弟做西装的时候是把婚前协议一起绣给我们的
Brooks Brothers sews prenups into all our suits.

280
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,280
- 你也离婚了 - 对啊 我骄傲

281

我和我丈夫做的最正确的一件事

听着 我听说你在彭博新闻上
Listen, I heard you on Bloomberg

284
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:52,920
大谈特谈我的经济头脑
talking about my financial acumen,

285
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:56,490
我只能说你太过分了
and I have to say you were wildly out of line.

286
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,820
我说的话大多数是为了节目效果
Well, most of that is just for show.

287
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,370
但是 出于对您的尊重 总统女士
But, with all due respect, Madam President,

288
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,290
您的一些经济政策
some of your economic policies

289
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:06,550
用我朋友凯蒂·格罗斯的话说 是一堆狗屎
are what my friend Katie Gross likes to call fakakta.

290
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,710
凯蒂·格罗斯 你认识她?
Katie Gross? You know Katie Gross?

291
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,190
我跟凯蒂·格罗斯的一起去的史密斯学院
I went to Smith with Katie Gross.

292
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,940
- 我跟凯蒂·格罗斯约会过 - 我也是
- I dated Katie Gross. - Yeah, so did I.

293
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,480
因为我上的是史密斯啊 不好意思这是个学校内部梗
'Cause I was at Smith. No, it's a Smith joke.

294
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,360
- 简直不可思议 - 这位是伊丽莎白·穆尔豪斯
- That's incredible. - This is Elizabeth Moorehouse.

295
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,590
- 你好吗 - 很好 谢谢
- Oh, hi, how are you? - I'm well, thank you.

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,600
- 感谢光临  - 我的荣幸 总统女士

297
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,360
我希望您能劝劝联邦储备局
I hope you can talk some sense into the fed.

298
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,860
对不起 打断一下
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt.

299
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:28,780
总统女士 凯蒂让我告诉您Hubbard万岁
Madam President, Katie says to tell you Hubbard forever.

300
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,250
- 不会吧  - 是的
- She didn't. - She did.

301
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,670
她不是吧 太搞笑了
She didn't! That's hilar--

302
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,410
那是我们的宿舍 超恶心的
that was our dorm and it was repulsive.

303
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,570
- 你认识凯蒂·格罗斯吗  - 有点耳熟
- You know Katie Gross? - It sounds familiar.

304
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:38,230
你肯定跟她见过
I bet your paths have crossed.

305
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,980
第二个签名是卡尔中风的时候签的
The second signature was when Carl had his stroke.

306
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,800
太棒了 我是说对我们来说很好
Oh, that's fantastic. I mean, fantastic for us

307
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,560
因为这意味着他投给梅耶总统的票是合法的
because it means that his vote for President Meyer is legitimate.

308
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,840
- 他可以作证吗  - 抱歉 他已经过世了
- Could he testify to that? - I'm sorry, he's passed.

309
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,280
节哀 你应该读读C.S.刘易斯关于悲痛的书
Sorry. You should read C.S. Lewis's book on grief.

310
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,460
倒是没有《狮子 巫师和壁橱》系列那么好玩
It's not as fun as "The Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe" Series,

311
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,370
- 但还是一本不错的书  - 女士 您好

Would it be all right if we waited for your husband inside?

315
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,410
- 我好想长了个水疱  - 抱歉啊
- I think I have a small blister. - I'm sorry.

316
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,360
愿安息 是希伯来语
Alav hashalom. Hebrew.

317
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:12,040
你是不是应该穿双正常的鞋子
Maybe you should put on your regular shoes for a little bit?

318
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:15,260
告诉你 我受够了你那个狗屁的微观管理
You know what? I am sick of your micromanaging bullshit.

319
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,670
但是如果你坚持的话 我可以去宾馆停一下
But if you insist, yes, I will stop by the hotel.

320
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:21,680
可以啊 走两分钟
We can do that. It's a two-minute walk.

321
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,780
不对 是两英里[约3.218km]
Oh, sorry, two miles.

322
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,870
老天爷
God.

快来看看 这既然不是巨星艾伦·德杰尼勒斯[艾伦秀]
Well, well, well, if it isn't TV's Ellen DeGeneres

326
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:32,270
那一定是艾米·布鲁克海默了
and of course Amy Brookheimer.

327
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,930
弗朗议员
Congressman Furlong, to what do we owe

328
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,270
什么阴风把您给吹来了
this pleasure slash skin-crawling sensation?

329

我刚到西部跟这个傻大个子Cosplay了一下
Well, I just came out West to play a little Cowboys and Injuns

330
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,370

331
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,010
说吧
Say it.

332
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:44,920
嚎
How.

333

我在帐篷里吃鸡鸡

实际上 鲍勃·布拉德利让我来这里
Actually, Bob Bradley asked me to come out here

336

闪瞎这些山炮的双眼
armadillo fuckers with my political star power.

嗨 艾米 丹
Hi, Amy, Dan.

340
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:00,940
- 嘿  - 都好不
- Hi again. - How you doing?

341
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,900
这不算重复投票吧
That is not an overvote.

342
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,410
投票人划掉了奥布莱恩的名字 投给了梅耶
The voter crossed out O'Brien's name and voted for Meyer.

343
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,860
这是给梅耶的一票啊
That is a vote for Meyer.

344
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:08,950
这个算重复投票
Move to rule it an overvote.

345
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,240
嘿 奶昔大哥[巨大紫色长毛麦当劳吉祥物] 你他妈...
Hey, Grimace. What are you...

346
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,130
不 没说你
no, no, no, not you.

347
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,080
我是说这个房间里另外一个长得跟奶昔大哥一毛一样的家伙
The other person in the room who looks exactly like Grimace.

348
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,620
这不是重复票了 你得相信我

349
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,300
因为在你妈从试图从楼梯上滚下来之前
because I've been doing this since before your mother

350
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,340
我就已经开始干这个活了
was throwing herself down the stairs belly first.

351
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,880
你要我帮你拿副眼镜来么?
You want me to get you some glasses?

352
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,660
或者我可以把奶酪市长找来?[同为麦当劳人偶]
Maybe I'll call in Mayor McCheese?

353
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,130
他可以进来跟你解释一下这个选举的过程
He can come in here and explain election procedures to you.

354
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,690
我没想
Oh, I'm not...

355
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,030
- 特蕾西 - 看 是因为你穿了紫色
- Tracy. - Look, it’s... you're wearing purple.

356
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,610
跟你的身材没什么关系
All right? It's got nothing to do with your body shape

357
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,190
也不是因为你的脑袋跟肩膀无缝衔接
or your the way your head goes into your shoulders so smoothly.

358
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,650
我们差不多得去下一场会议了
Hey, you know, we have to get to your next meeting at the

359

对 说得好 上帝保佑你

God bless America.

361
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,100
当你心情平复了之后
When you're ready,

362
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,430
我们想要严正质疑一下你的决定
we would like to vigorously contest your ruling.

363
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,480
女士 我有一些金融特遣小组的照片需要批准
Oh, ma'am, I have photos to approve from the banking task force.

364
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,300
然后您在五分钟之后要跟奥林匹克获奖者见面
And you have a meeting with Olympic medalists in five.

365
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,750
残疾的还是正常的?
Special or normal?

366
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,400
他们看起来挺正常 不过我会确认一下
they seemed normal, but I'll confirm.

367
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,930
好的
Okay.

368
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:03,530
你昨晚在电视上看《教父》了嘛?
So you catch "The Godfather" On TV last night?

369
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,680
- 没有 - 没有什么能比得上
- No. - There was nothing like seeing it in the theater

370
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:10,780
1972年在电影院里看这部电影了
when it first came out back in '72.

371
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,740
我不关心电影
I don't care for movies.

372
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:19,810
你的划船事业实在是为我们美国争了光
You've truly brought honor to America with your kayaking.

373
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,770
恭喜你获得金牌
So congratulations on your gold medal.

374
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,910
- 铜牌 - 噢是铜牌
- It's bronze. - Oh. Oh, bronze medal.

375
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,820
拍到了吗? 谢谢你送给我这个
Did we get it? Oh, and thank you for this.

376
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,580
我等不及要去波托马克河试一把了
I can't wait to try it out on the Potomac.

377
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,310
- 好了 往这边走 - 好的

378
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:33,450
好样的
Great. Great. Great. Great. Okay.

379
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,430
我他妈能拿这玩意干毛使?
Fuck am I supposed to do with this?

380
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,310
- 放你图书馆估计会不错 - 啥?
- It'd be nice for your library. - What?

381
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,220
凯瑟琳 出去
Catherine, out.

382
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,040
所以媒体怎么说我们的金融特遣组?
So what's the press saying about our banking task force?

383
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,280
他们喜欢得合不拢腿
They opened wide and slurped it down, ma'am.

384
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,580
你知道我在想什么吗?
You know what I was thinking?

385
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,030
我想啊
I was thinking that I

386
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,600
我想再成立一个金融特遣组
would like to do another banking task force.

387
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,670
我们估计能请来巴克莱银行的帕伦贝格
I bet we could get Pallenberg at Barclays.

388
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,300
很好啊
I see no problem there.

389
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,460
不要 那个懂很多的韦瑞特公司的
No, you know who had a lot to say was that guy from Wheelright.

390
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,200
查理... 贝尔德
Charlie... Baird.

391
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,860
- 你当真? - 是啊
- Really? - Uh-huh.

392
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,060
女士 我觉得现在吧
Ma'am, I don't think right now

393
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,130
不适合成立另一个金融特遣组
would be the best time for another banking task force.

394
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,810
我就想要个简单快速的金融特遣组
No, I just want to have a quick banking task force.

395
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:13,710
听我一言 女士 您要知道
With all due respect, ma'am, you know, the banks will still be,

396
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,580
金融还是会在那儿 等您的特遣的
you know, raring to go for a task force,

397
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,310
您要等自己成功选上总统之后
you know, when you're safely reelected.

398
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:22,000
我也是人好吗? 我就是想要...
I'm human, okay? I just...

399
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:27,020
我就是需要一点点的金融特遣组啊
I just sometimes need a little banking task force.

400
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,080
女士 如果你想要的话
Well, ma'am, if you want,

401
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,890
我可以安排一个低调私密的小组
I can arrange a more discreet banking task force.

402
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,880
我才不要那种金融特遣组
I don't want that kind of banking task force.

403
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:34,830
我要我看上的金融特遣组
I want the banking task force that I want.

404
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
德国银行的帕蒂·得利斯怎么样?
What about Patty Driscoll from Deutsche Bank?

405
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,220
她能力很强 在组里加一个女性也许很有利
She's very good. Might be nice to throw a woman in the mix.

406
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,470
女士 艾米的视频会议
Ma'am, Amy's on video conference.

407
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,910
艾米 怎么了?
Amy, what is it?

00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,850
- 您能看到我吗? 我看不到你 - 好吧
- Can you see me? I can't see you. - Yeah.

409
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,180
- 我在你的屏幕上吗? - 看不看得到有关系吗?
- Am I on your screen? - Who cares if you can't see me?

410
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,470
我们又不是在找对方的头皮屑
We're not looking at each other's hairdos.

411
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,440
内华达州怎么样了?
What's going on in Nevada?

412
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,260

把她挂了 等下 凯瑟琳呢?

427
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,230
她应该把这段拍进她的小电影里
She should be getting this for her little movie.

428
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,110
我头有点晕
I'm feeling light-headed.

429
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,370
那瓶子是我唯一的血糖来源了
That bottle's my only source of blood sugar.

430
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:35,990
好了 盖瑞 我需要跟查理·贝尔德再见一面
Okay, Gary, I'm wanna get Charlie Baird in for another meeting.

您想要我再邀请别的人吗
You want me to invite some other people?

432
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:38,880
- 不不不 就他 - 噢

433
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980

喏 你的傻瓶子
Here's your stupid bottle.

435
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:44,110
别演日本歌舞伎了 吃块饼干去吧
Stop with the Kabuki show and eat a fucking cookie.

436
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:48,510
迈克  跟我讲一下这后面的科学依据
Uh, Mike, remind me again the science behind this.

437

现在我感觉可棒了
Now I feel great.

438
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:57,940
你们真的得试试这个
You guys have got to try this.

439
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:00,910
星期天的脱口秀里面我们需要找人去
We need surrogates for the Sunday talk shows.

440
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,280
- 对哦 - 陈州长说他会去
- Right. - Chung will do it.

441
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,870
为了全国转播
Chung would volunteer for

442
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,690
被砍头的视频他也会报名去的
a beheading video to get national airtime.

443
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,020
我其实还蛮想看的
I'd actually like to see that.

444
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:09,680
女士 汤姆·詹姆斯来这里见你
Ma'am, Tom James is here sans appointment.

445
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:13,520
你能去让他操一袋玻璃渣啥的吗?
Bleh. Can you go tell him to fuck a bag of glass or something?

446
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,550
其实 我差不多说了一样的
Actually, I told him something

447
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,510
不过他好像蛮坚持要见你的
similar to that, but he's most insistent.

448
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,220
好吧 带他进来
Oh, okay. Send him in.

449
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,590
嘿 这简直是意外的惊喜
Hi there. This is an unexpected pleasure.

450
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,030
不 大家 我想要你们也听着
No, no, no, guys. I want you to hear this.

451
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,190
女士 对我来说 我完全可以理解
Ma'am, on reflection, I totally understand

452
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,840
为什么你想要带头领导金融特遣组
why you needed to take the lead on the banking task force.

453
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:34,570
而且我已经全力做好帮助这个小组的准备了
And I am ready to do whatever I need to do to help the team.

454
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:39,490
所以 不论是经济专家 还是小孩的生日聚会 还是当可怜人
So, economy czar, kids' birthday parties, reflecting pool boy.

455
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,060
只是别让我当联合国大使
Just don't ask me to be the United Nations ambassador

456
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,000
我还是要点脸的
cause I still have some pride.

457
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,680
就不打扰你们了
I wanted to say that and I'll leave you guys alone.

458
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,790
- 非常感谢 - 谢谢 很高兴见到你
- Thank you so much. - Oh, great. Thanks. Good to see you.

459
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,910
对了 我刚把艾森豪威尔行政办公室的地板擦亮了
Oh, by the way, I just polished the floor in the Eisenhower Room.

460
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,600
- 汤姆 少来了 - 在那儿要小心点哦
- Tom, stop. - Be careful in there, all right?

461
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:59,340
- 这是干啥? - 的确不对劲
- Huh? - That was something.

462
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,130
为什么汤姆·詹姆斯突然把他的蛋蛋打包好
Why did Tom James just wrap up

463
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:03,040
还主动给我放钱包里啊?
his balls in butcher paper and put them in my purse?

464
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,240
因为他觉得你会拿下内华达州
Because he thinks you're gonna win Nevada.

465
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:07,930
- 汤姆觉得我会拿下内花达? - 是的
- Tom thinks I'm gonna win Nevada? - Yeah.

466
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,480
- "内华达" - 他才是首都最精明的人呢？
- "Nev-add-a." - He's the smartest guy in DC.

467
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,460
看到没? 他可比你们这些蠢蛋聪明多了
You know that? He's a lot smarter than you dummies.

468
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,140
说真的 要是汤姆认为我会赢的话 我肯定能赢
Seriously, if Tom thinks I'm gonna win Nevada, I'm gonna win.

469
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:18,670
女士 查理·贝尔德来这儿了
Ma'am, Charlie Baird is here.

470
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,480
嘿 我又会继续当总统了
Hey, I'm gonna be president,

471
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:26,030
要是我想的话 我都可以在玫瑰园拉屎了
so I can go take a shit in the Rose Garden if I want to.

472
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,030
我们过去称那为吉米·卡特（美国第39任总统）
We used to call that a Jimmy Carter.

473
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,700
查理·贝尔德 让开
Charlie Baird. Move.

474
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,230
总统女士 我好惊喜啊
Madam President. What a lovely surprise.

475
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,200
谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

476
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:36,990
我还以为我2000美元的捐款只能让我拍张照呢
I thought my $2,000 donation only entitled me to a photo.

477
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,760
- 你好吗? - 很好 充满活力
- How are you? - I am good. I am energized.

478
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,040
对了 你早些时候说到的关于
So, you know, you made an

479
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:43,440
债券市场很有意思的点...
interesting point earlier today about the bond market...

480
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,290
要不然这样 谈正事之前
but you know what? Before we do that,

481
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,400
你想先逛逛
would you like to go on

482
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,170
白宫西厢吗?
a tour of the West Wing? Would that be fun?

483
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,140
不确定您有时间做这个
I don't know if you have time for that,

484
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,080
我有
Yeah, I have time.

485
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,560
- 好啊 - 那好
- Okay. - Yeah? Okay.

486
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,950
提醒一下 我五年级班级旅游时
I warn you, I had a pretty comprehensive

487
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,720
已经把白宫里里外外参观过一遍了噢
White House tour on my fifth grade class trip.

488
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,460
实际上我了解不少西厢的历史 要是你感... 不
I actually know a lot about West Wing history if you'd like... no.

489
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,000
我感觉那个人好像不太喜欢我啊
I feel like that guy doesn't like me very much.

490
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,450
- 谁 盖瑞? - 对
- Who, Gary? - Yeah.

491
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,500
不可能 你这样说就像说哪只猫不喜欢你
Come on, that's like saying that the cat doesn't like you

492
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,800
或者说那台桌子不喜欢你一样
or that table doesn't like you.

493
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,340
往前走有幅诺曼·洛克威尔的话
Okay, now, there's this Rockwell down here

494
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:11,100
太迷人了 我发誓
that is so stunning and

495
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:12,970
要是选举落败了的话
I swear to God if I lose this fucking election,

496
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,180
我一定要把它放在我的行李箱中带走
I'm gonna stick it in my suitcase and I'm taking it with me.

497
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,570
- 我爱洛克威尔 - 是啊
- Love Rockwell. - Yeah.

498
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:19,020
- 我有一大堆他的作品 - 你有?
- I have a bunch of Rockwells. - You do?

499
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,330
- 是啊 - 别骗我
- Yeah. - You're kidding.

500
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,820
- 说真的 - 在哪儿呢?
- No. - Where are they?

501
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,570
海滨别墅里
Some beach house.

502
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,050
- 不确定在哪个海边 - 真有你的
- Not sure which beach. - You are wild.

503
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,760
要是别人这样说 我肯定觉得他在吹牛
In another person it would be bragging,

504
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,180
你就不同了
but with you it's something different.

505
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,520
等会儿 我得让你看看这里
Oh, wait a minute. I got to show you this.

506
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:35,640
看到这个贮藏室了吗?
Okay, see this closet?

507
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:36,860
不知道你听说过没
I don't know if you've heard about this,

508
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,170
沃伦·哈定就在这儿和他未成年的情妇
but this is the actual closet where Warren Harding

509
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:43,050
搞了一个孩子出来
fathered a child with his teenage mistress.

510
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,800
我五年级参观时 他们可没讲这个
They left that off our fifth grade tour.

511
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,360
他们带你们参观了居住室吗?
Did they show you the residence?

512
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:51,370
没呢
Nope.

513
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,270
你想看吗?
Uh, you want to see the residence?

514
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,240
当然
Uh, yeah.

515
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,720
好
Okay.

516
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,020
- 卧槽 今天 - 是投今天一票的意思吗?
- Fuck, today. - Now, was that a vote in favor of today?

517
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:05,930
就是卧槽 逗号 今天的意思 当然是啦
Oh, that was a fuck, comma, today, yes!

518
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,630
那个... 我住这儿
Oh, I didn't... yeah, this is me.

519
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,850
我住这儿
This is me. Uh...

520
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,550
- 晚安 - 晚安
- Okay, good night. - Good night, yeah.

521
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,160
- 该死 别这样啊
- God damn it. Come on. -

522
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:18,670
天啊
Jesus Christ.

523
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,090
我又得去换一次钥匙卡了
I've had to get this key card changed twice.

524
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,200
- 因为它... - 让我来
- Because it's like... - Okay, allow me.

525
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:32,240
- 嗨 艾米 - 哇哦
- Ooh, hi, Amy. - Whoa.

526
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,910
你可没告诉我这个基佬发型男在这儿
You didn't tell me faggy hair was here.

527
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,840
苏菲 几年没见了
Sophie, haven't seen you in years.

528
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,750
你的私生子们过得还好吗?
How are your illegitimate children?

529
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,060
我让我姐给我寄换洗衣服来
I asked my sister to send me a change of clothes

530
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,730
没想到她亲自送来了
and apparently she has decided to bring them herself.

531
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,560
- 这样啊 - 这个旅馆房间糟糕死了
- Uh-huh. - Your hotel room sucks.

532
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,470
我还以为卡森市是拉斯维加斯的一部分呢
I thought that Carson City was, like, part of Las Vegas.

533
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,280
维加斯在432公里之外呢
Vegas is 432 miles away.

534
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,630
不好意思我不是什么"地图全知道"怪咖
Sorry I'm not a "Where everything is" Nerd.

535
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,440
你们俩之前是准备来一炮吗?
Were you two just about to bone?

536
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,560
这
Okay, well,

537
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,080
你慢慢享受吧
you enjoy all that.

538
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,930
- 我得... - 别 别 别啊
- I'm gonna... - Oh, no, no, no.

539
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,430
在拉斯维加斯就要及时行乐啊
What happens in Vegas, it stays in Vegas.

540
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,370
这不是拉斯维加斯
We're not in Vegas.

541
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,740
要知道 我可从没和休斯总统这么干过呢
You know, I hardly ever did that with President Hughes.

542
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,150
就算做
And even when we did,

543
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,560
我也是走走过场
I was just kind of going through the motions.

544
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,400
谢谢你哈 太受宠若惊了
Oh, thank you very much. That's very flattering.

545
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,950
- 也许我们能... - 我们得走了
- Maybe we can do this... - We got to get you out of here.

546
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,320
- 好 - 我要打电话给盖瑞
- Right. - I'm gonna call Gary

547
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,720
让他把你送到东南大门
and get him to take you to the southeast gate.

548
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,110
请让盖瑞接一下电话 谢谢
Can you send Gary up here, please? Yeah, thank you.

549
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:27,260
- 但我真觉得很高兴 - 别这样 我也是的
- But I really did have a great time. - No, no, no, I did, too.

550
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:29,880
我的意思是 我不是那种总统
I mean, I'm just saying I'm not that kind of a president.

551
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,030
- 我懂 - 你看见我的鞋了吗?
- Got it. - Yeah. Do you know where my shoes are?

552
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:35,180
- 好像... 我们在那儿开始的 - 看到了
- I think you... we started in there. - Yes, they're here.

553
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:40,250
- 进来! - 走吧
- Come in! - Okay, let's go.

554
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,720
你一定是盖瑞吧 我们还没正式打过招呼呢
You must be Gary. We haven't officially met.

555
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,930
我是查理·贝尔德
I'm Charlie Baird.

556
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:46,960
很高兴见到你
Uh, nice to meet you.

557
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,400
你是哪里人?

你看 即使你赢了大选 也没什么意义
Look, if you win the election, it doesn't mean anything anyway.

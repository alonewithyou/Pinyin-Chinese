医生说那个清肠没有造成永久性伤害
Doctor says the cleanse caused no lasting damage.

149
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,220
总统账户的推特账号很活跃?

What is he doing?

174
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,110

但我不是那么教的啊...
But that's not the way I showed you to do...

181
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,410
你就是那么教的
That's exactly the way that you showed me to do it.

182

那我去泡点茶
Okay, I'll just go make some tea.

187
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,220
你还是歇着吧
You better not.

188
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,730
瑞典首相刚才
The Swedish prime minister

189
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,550
用笑炸了的表情转了你那条推文
just retweeted your tweets with an LOL.

190
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,700
操蛋的我们接下来怎么办?
Well, what the FOL are we supposed to do about this?

191
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,780
我们干脆死不承认
I suggest that we disavow the tweets.

192
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,930
反正手机一直都遭到黑客攻击
Phones are hacked all the time

193
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:42,020
老是有名人的漏丁丁照艳照什么的被扒出来
to steal pictures of celebrities' penises and whatnot.

194
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,550
- 我的天啊 - 等等 肯特
- Oh, my God. - Hold that thought, Kent.

195
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,210
总统女士 你确定这是你本人发的吗?
Madam President, are you sure you did this?

196
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,790
你什么意思 我本人?
What do you mean, am I sure?

197
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,220
对啊 也许白宫的电脑系统
Well, maybe the White

198
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,310
并没有我们想象的那么安全
House computers aren't as secure as we think.

199
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:54,100
也许白宫防火墙的漏洞
Maybe the firewalls have more holes in them

200
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:55,680
比淘金女子宫帽上的洞都多呢
than a gold digger's diaphragm.

201
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,060
我天 我最讨厌子宫帽了
My God, I hated those things.

202
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:58,950
等一下
Wait a minute.

203
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,780
- 今天些是有个黑客袭击来着 - 嗯...
- There was a breach earlier today. - Mm-hmm.

204
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,620
对啊 我的老天 也许那些推文跟黑客有关呢
Oh, my God, and maybe that breach concerned those tweets.

205
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,490
- 有这个可能啊 - 我的老天
- Maybe it did. - Oh, my God,

206
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,280
也许跟你一点关系都没有呢
maybe you had nothing to do with it.

207
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,500
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

208
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,890
这样的话 你的私信被公开
In that case, China would be blamed

209
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:18,210
或许可以怪到中国头上了
for your messages going public, maybe.

210
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
我认为情况应该是这样的?
So is that what I think happened?

211
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,410
是中国那边发的推文?
That China tweeted this?

212
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,980
不 女士 你压根儿不知道发生了什么事
Oh, no, ma'am, no. You have no idea what happened.

213
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,220
迈克也不知道 他十分愤怒
And neither does Mike, who would be outraged by this.

214
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,800
女士 我有个更好的主意
Actually, ma'am, I have a better idea.

215
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,780
不 迈克 历史证明你不会有好点子
No, you don't, Mike. History has proven that.

216
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,330
我去跟鲍勃商量下
Now, let me just run this by Bob

217
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,430
看看他是不是也同意让中国背锅
and see if he thinks blaming China is a good idea.

218
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,210
- 跟谁都不能提这事 - 能还是不能?
- This can't leave this room. - Can or can't?

219
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,520
- 不能 迈克 - 不能!
- It cannot, Mike. - Not!

220
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,150
为什么不干脆说出事实呢?
Why don't you just tell the truth?

221
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,980
- 我说话不是那样的 - 你听起来就这样!
- I don't sound like that. - That's exactly how you sound.

222
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,660
- 才不是 - 就是
- No, I don't. - Spot-on.

223
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,180
是挺像的
Yeah, it's pretty close.

224
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,940
我都不知道你从哪模仿来的
I don't know where you get that impersonation.

225
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:54,160
女士 你得赶快决定啊
Ma'am, you have to make a decision now.

226
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,660
我真的能让另一个毫无干系的国家
I mean, can I really blame another country

227
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,030
替我们背这个锅吗?
for something they didn't do?

228
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,280
西美战争后这一直是
It's been the cornerstone of American foreign policy

229
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,860
美国外交政策的主打策略啊
since the Spanish American War.

230
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,100
今天早晨白宫网络安全系统再一次遭到袭击
This morning the White House cybersecurity was breached

231
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,960
美国国家安全局相信本次
by what the NSA has come to believe was a hack

232
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,230
黑客袭击来自中国大陆
that originated in mainland China.

233
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,300
迈克 那总统发的那条
Mike, Mike, what about

234
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,580
跟奥布莱恩有关的推文是怎么回事?
the president's tweet about Senator O'Brien?

235
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:17,000
总统非常震惊
The president was horrified.

236
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,540
对于最近这起网络安全事件她非常震惊

237
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,020
总统相信网络安全工作

00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:28,010
对美国的未来生存至关重要
for the United States' future survival.

239
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,910
肯特 选票方面有什么进展吗
Kent, any progress on the ballots?

240
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,020
我已经排除了八个县
I've eliminated eight counties as potential locales,

241
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,680
但是还是需要我来
but there's no way around my doing

242
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,080
一个区一个区地做线性回归分析
a district-by-district regression analysis.

243
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,650
肯特你是废话越多工资越高吗? 本 翻译一下?
Are we paying you by the word here, Kent, or what? Ben?

244
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,630
他需要更多时间 女士 奥布莱恩演讲直播
He needs more time. Ma'am, we got O'Brien on a live feed.

245
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,880
这个躲不过啊 听听吧
Oh, boy. Well, we knew this was coming. Let's hear it.

246
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,830
我对总统那些狭隘的言论不作回应
I will not dignify the president's petty remarks with a response.

247
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,810
他这就是在回应啊
And yet he's responding.

248
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,750
但我想指出
I do, however, want to point out

249
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,560
目前有2900万人
that over 29 million people

250
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,250
在受着各种糖尿病的折磨
suffer from various forms of diabetes.

251
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:01,360
- 谁在乎这个? - 我真正担心的
- Oh, who cares? - What truly troubles me, however,

252
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,180
是梅耶尔总统在面对明显的侵犯举动时
is President Meyer's timid response

253
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,840
回应却十分软弱
to a clear act of aggression.

254
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,020
看到了吗?
Did you just see that? Okay?

255
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,010
现在我们得处理下中国了
We're gonna have to do something about China now.

256
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,020
- 不 你不用 女士 - 我需要强硬一点啊
- No, you don't, ma'am. - I need to look strong.

257
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,870
- 如果我们输了内花拉 - 是内华达
- If we lose Nevada... - "Nev-add-a."

258
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,860
...奥布莱恩到时候 在议院会用中国这事玩死我们
...O'Brien is gonna kill us in the House over this China thing.

259
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,820
事实上是中国...
In reality, ma'am, China...

260
00:10:19,850 --> 00:10:22,180
事实? 本 我知道事实是什么
In reality? I know reality, Ben.

261
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,390
是你非要让我们住在《黑客帝国》的矩阵里
You're the one who suggested we all live in the Matrix.

262
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,780
- 女士 没有人能让谁住在矩阵里 - 什么?
- Ma'am, nobody chose to live in the Matrix. - What?

263
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,610
事实上是母体造反 然后把人们困在里面
The machines rose up and placed humans in the Matrix

264
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,920
把他们当成生物电源
so they could use them as a biological power source.

265
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,940
- 那你站在哪一边? - 那定向制裁呢?
- Whose side were you on? - What about targeted sanctions?

266
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,920
这看起来很强硬啊 不是吗?
That will send a message of real strength, won't it?

267
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,740
或者我们可以请联合国发布...
Or we could go to the United Nations and have them issue...

268
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,640
请求他们干什么? 请求他们
Have them what? Have them

269
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,640
帮我们把车停在消防栓前面?
help us park in front of a fire hydrant?

270
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,470
得了吧
I mean, come on.

271
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,250
夫人 你现在关注的应该是内华达
Ma'am, your focus now should be on Nevada.

272
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:52,560
不要忘了 我才是总统
I'm president, in case you forgot.

273
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,730
我知道该关注什么
I know what I should focus on.

274
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,540
对不起 总统女士
Sorry, ma'am.

275
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,140
天啊 你还在这?
Jesus, you're still here?

276
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,400
我不知道怎么回事 看起来我唯一的工作就是
I don't know why. My only jobs seem to be

277
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,080
询问鲍勃然后猜他在想什么
asking Bob and finding out what Bob thinks.

278
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,160
我围观还挺有意思的
Yeah, it's been pretty fun to watch.

279
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:11,250
喝两杯去?
So you want to grab a drink or something?

280
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,120
不了谢谢
No, thanks.

281
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,730
对了 你能不能顺便在ABC新闻
Oh, but on your way, would you mind stopping

282
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,730
那停一下买点布洛芬
at ABC News and picking up some Advil?

283
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,830
哎呀 我是不是说成了了ABC新闻? 我其实是说来爱德
Oh, did I say ABC News? I meant Rite Aid.

284
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,270
你是不是忘了点啥 艾米
Yeah, I think you're forgetting something, Amy,

285
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,780

286
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,900
晚安 祝你晚安
Good night, have a pleasant evening,

287
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,890
我睡了你妹妹

00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:59,230
我还有工作要做
No, I got some more work to do.

在我任总统之后
And when I'm president,

327
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,700
我们会不竭余力地守卫着我们的电子国界
we will defend our digital borders

328
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,860
就像我们守卫我们现实的国界一样
just as diligently as we defend our physical ones.

329
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,480
是我 帮我接安全线路
Yeah, can I get a secure line?

330

这是布拉德利
Bradley.

331
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,820
鲍勃 没吵醒你吧
Bob, oh, God, I hope I'm not waking you.

332
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,390
没 我总是醒着的
No, no, I'm always awake.

333
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,840
太好了 中国的那事
Great. So this China thing.

334
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,270
他们确实黑了我们
They did hack us,

335
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,320
但是他们并没有黑掉我的推特账号
but they didn't exactly hack my Twitter account.

336
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:36,640
- 不用多说了 总统女士 - 我就知道
- Say no more, Madam President. - Oh, God, I knew it.

337
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,090
我就知道你会懂的 鲍勃
I knew you would understand, Bob.

338
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,890
我终于能和专业的人说说这种感觉真的太棒了
It is so nice to finally be talking to a professional here.

339
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:44,200
我是这么想的 如果我对中国不强硬
This is how I see it, okay? If I'm soft on China,

340
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,100
我在议院就完蛋了啊
I'm gonna get killed in the House.

341
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:48,030
你的直觉告诉你需要强硬一点
Your instincts are telling you you should be strong.

342
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,230
是的 你觉得我的直觉是对的?
Yes, you think my instincts are right?

343
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,240
熊在洗澡的时候会撒尿吗?
Does a bear piss in the shower?

344
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,840
- 你需要领导他们 - 没错我就是领导
- You should lead. - I'm the leader.

345
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,460
- 你抓了鱼 现在掏它的内脏 - 掏出来
- You caught the fish, now gut the fish. - Gut the fish.

你穿上消防头盔 现在把火灭掉
You're wearing the fireman's hat, now put out the fire.

347
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,840
- 是的! 这比电话做爱都爽 - 我刚都射了
- Yes! This is better than phone sex. - Well, I just came.

348
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,010
让针对制裁见鬼去吧
Forget threatening sanctions.

349
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:07,940
我就应该号召国会直接去征他们的税
I should call on Congress directly to levy them.

350
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,530
这是一招险棋 总统女士
That's a bold move, Madam President,

351
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,420
但险棋制胜 你的威望就回来了
and one that'll only earn you respect.

352
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,420
鲍勃 太感谢你了

看起来可以让奥布莱恩闭嘴了吧?
Well, that seems to have shut O'Brien up, huh?

366
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,290
- 又发现了一条剑龙 - 与我何干
- There's a new stegosaurus. - That's not my problem.

367
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,730
- 当然了 夫人 - 嘿艾米

你注意到鲍勃有点奇怪吗?
Have you noticed anything weird about Bob?

00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,750
昨晚挺奇怪的
He was acting a little off last night.

374
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,090
鲍勃本来就怪怪的
That's just Bob being Bob.

375
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,940
我知道怎么回事了
No, I know what this is about.

376
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,870
艾米 你知道你对这次选举很重要对吧?
Amy, you know that you are very important to the campaign, right?

377
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,810
- 不 这不是... - 不艾米 听着你做得很好

非常了不起啊 艾米
One heck of a job, Amy.

381
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,220
如果老鹰告诉你 自己表现的很奇怪

382
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,370
— 你会听他的吗? - 当然
- would you listen to him? - Yeah.

383
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,760
我们必须得相信老鹰
You got to trust the Eagle.

384
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,090
为什么? 他跟你说了什么
Why? Did he say something to you?

385
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,250
惠特曼会议

386
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,250
内华达 卡森城

387
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,540
大家关手机了吗?
Is everybody's cell phone off?

388
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,700
当然 这种东西都致癌的 你知道的
Yeah. Those things cause cancer, you know.

389

- 很就不见了吧? - 是啊 确实
- Been a while, huh? - Yeah, it has indeed.

391
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:44,230
我记得上次还是和你妻子一起在你的滑雪小屋里吧
I think the last time was at your ski cabin with your wife.

392
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,480
最起码那个小屋还是我的
I still got the cabin.

393
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,230
鲍勃 离认证这么近
So, Bob, neither of us have

394
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,620
我们都没有时间浪费
time to waste with the certification so close.

395
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,420
这次你来有何贵干?
What's on your mind?

396
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,150
我们的处境就像 把手指伸进外婆的苹果派里
What we have here is a classic thumb

397
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:59,220
外婆对我们暴跳如雷
in the apple pie situation and Grandma is mad as hell.

398
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,930
- 她花一整天做饭... -听着 鲍勃
- She spent all day cooking... - Look, Bob. Bob.

399
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,040
我们都知道你友好得就像奶油灯一样
We all know you're as folksy as a butter churn lamp,

400
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,700
但是我还是直奔主题了
but let me cut to the chase.

401
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,010
我就看来 朋友
From where I'm sitting, my boy's ahead.

402
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,390
如果你是来求我给你更多时间的话
If you're here to beg for more time,

403
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,250
你还是带着你的帽子和手杖另请高明吧
take your cup and cane elsewhere.

404
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,470
别急
Hold that thought.

405
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,180
美国自然历史博物馆

406
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,180

- 是从印度带回来的吗? - 我不知道 戴上了吗?
- Did this come from India? - I don't know. Did you get it?

409
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,940
这一身都充满格蕾丝·凯利的韵味
Just all of this just screams Grace Kelly.

410
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,980
- 我知道 - 查理会为你疯掉的
- I know. - Charlie is gonna flip.

411
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,480
- 我不喜欢这眼妆 - 什么?
- I don't like my eyes, though. - What?

412
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:40,090
我觉得我眼睛下面挂了两个尿布袋似的
Yeah, I feel like I've got two diaper bags underneath.

413
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,100
- 不 我觉得不... - 妈呀
- No, no, no, no. I don't think... - Oh, God.

414

- 鲍勃 - 晚上好
- Oh, Bob. - Evening.

416
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,460
你准备好要去惠特曼的会议了对吧?
Hi, you're getting ready to go to the Whitman meeting, right?

417
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,430
是的 从来没有一个惠特曼
Mm-hmm, there's never been a Whitman's Sampler

418
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,370
能够逃出我的手掌心
I couldn't take apart

419
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,570
我会把他们弄成一片一片的 总统女士
piece by piece and shit out, Madam President.

420
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:56,360
你这么说我真是太开心了 好了
I love to hear that. Okay,

421
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,840
你怎么跟个肉瘤子似的挂在我身上
you're hanging on to me like a skin tag.

422
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:58,960
你能不能去告诉查理
Hey, you know what? Could you

423
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,090
我一会就过去?

- 好的好的 当然 - 谢谢
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. - Thank you very much.

425
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,100
我和肯特谈过了
So listen, I talked to Kent and he really needs

426
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,670
他需要尽可能多的时间 所以你要
as much time as possible, so whatever you could do

427
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,930
使出浑身解数争取更多机会来推迟... 鲍勃?
to buy more time to delay the certifica... Bob?

428
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:15,120
鲍勃? 你还好吗? 能听到我讲话么?
Bob? Are you all right? Can you hear me?

431
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,340
鲍勃 你还好么?
Bob, are you okay?

432
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,860
妈个鸡 你听我说啊
Oh, fuck. You know what?

433
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:30,180
我在想... 要不咱们把会议推迟吧
I wonder... I think maybe we should delay the meeting.

434
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,010
想都别想 总统先生
Oh, not a chance, Mr. President.

435
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,590
- 我已经蓄势待发了 - 是总统女士
- I'm locked and loaded. - Madam President.

436
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:37,900
女总统? 估计要等到2000年吧
A lady president? Yeah, maybe in the year 2000.

437
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,690
鲍勃! 天呐!
Bob! Oh, my God. Jesus Christ!

438
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,010
- 贝尔德先生 贝尔德先生 我很抱歉 - 失陪一下
- Mr. Baird, Mr. Baird. I'm so sorry. - Excuse me.

439
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,300
我知道大家都在等她 但是
I know everybody's waiting, but

440
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,200
她刚才发短信来说她要晚一点才能过来
she just texted and she's running a little bit late.

441
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,460
你确实她是发短信告诉你的? 还是说她已经发推昭告天下了?
You sure she just texted or did she tweet the entire world?

442
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,450
没事没事 她不在这
It's okay, she's not here.

443
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,140
好的吧 那我们就先入座吧
All right, then let's just sit down.

444
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,840
- 等等 你是想... - 没事没事 别紧张
- Wait, you want... - It's fine. It's fine.

445
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,340
- 她不会在乎的 - 我不知道...
- She won't care. - I don't know if...

446
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,400
霍华德 你能帮我给我兄弟挪个座么?
Howard, would you do me a favor and slide over for my pal?

447
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,740
- 当然 - 我不知道这样到底好不好
- Sure. - I don't know if this is such a good idea.

448
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,740
我花25万美金把桌子都买下来了 坐吧
It's 250 grand. I bought the table. Sit down.

449
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,400
盖瑞是梅耶政府的重要成员
Gary is a key member of the Meyer administration.

450
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,960
这么说真是太恭维我了
So kind. Thank you.

451
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,030
- 你有名片么? - 没 我只有个包
- You have a card? - No, just a bag.

452
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,660
伙计们 鲍勃肯定有问题
Guys, something is deeply wrong with Bob.

453
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,880
- 啥? - 我是说比血尿还严重的坏事
- What? - I'm talking like blood in the urine wrong.

454
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,050
对 我一直都想告诉你这个
Yes, that's what I've been trying to tell you.

455
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,880
不 不是现在 艾米 好吗? 专心一点呀
No, not now, Amy, okay? Just focus on this.

456
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,900
艾米 大事不好了
Amy, this is really bad.

457
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,770
你好啊 女士
Oh, hello, ma'am.

458
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:31,260
- 什么不好了? - 我能不能先告诉艾米 然后让她给你转达?
- What's bad? - Can I tell Amy and have her tell you?

459
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,780
乔纳 赶紧说 到底是什么事
Jonah, just speak. What is it?

460
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,630
女士 我一直想帮布拉德利先生
Ma'am, I've been trying to get Mr. Bradley on the phone

461
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,640
接通《拉斯维加斯公报》的内德·米歇尔的电话
with Ned Mitchell from the "Las Vegas Gazette."

462
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:40,800
- 没错 - 但是内德·米歇尔在2006年就去世了
- Right. - Ned Mitchell died in 2006.

463
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,680
《拉斯维加斯公报》
And the "Las Vegas Gazette"

464
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,070
- 也在2007的时候停刊了 - 我的天哪
- Stopped publishing in 2007. - Oh, my God.

465
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:47,260
我联系上了《雷诺之星》的苏珊·贝利
I was able to get in touch with Susan Bailey at the "Reno Star,"

466
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,760
《雷诺之星》不是一份报纸 而是一家合法妓院
which is not a newspaper, it's a legal brothel.

467
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,080
但她似乎很开心能够
But she did seem excited to

468
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,910
尽她所能帮助我们的竞选
help the campaign in whichever way she could.

469
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,910
天哪 女士 对不起
Jesus Christ, ma'am. I'm so sorry.

470
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,560
他看起来跟原来的鲍勃没啥两样啊
He just seemed like the same old Bob to me.

471
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,720
女士 今天早上他告诉我犹太人导致了飓风
Ma'am, this morning he told me the Jews cause hurricanes.

472
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,980
他刚进去和惠特曼会面了!
He just went into this Whitman meeting, you guys!

473
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,670
如果他要在桌子拉屎啥的怎么办?
What if he takes a shit on the table or something?

474
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:07,020
女士 以他的年龄来说 如果他能在
Ma'am, at his age, if he can take

475
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:09,090
自己想拉屎的时候拉屎的话 这就算是个重大胜利了
a shit whenever he wants, that's a major victory.

476
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,230
艾米这个会议绝对不能
All right, Amy, this meeting cannot make it

477
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,930
活过教科书仓库大楼
past the School Book Depository.

478
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,590
我马上准备枪去第六层[肯尼迪遇刺凶手发射于教科书仓库大楼六层]
I'm loading my gun and heading to the sixth floor.

479
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,010
快去! 本 先别挂
Well, then, go, go, go! Ben, don't hang up.

480
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,130
- 我有些事情要告诉你 - 好的
- I've got to tell you something. - Uh-oh.

481
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,780
鲍勃知道没有中国黑客的事了
Bob knows there wasn't a Chinese hack.

482
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,840
我可能告诉他了
I think I might have told him.

483
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,980
别担心 女士
Well, don't worry, ma'am.

484
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,080
我们会把他塞到内华达起飞的第一架飞机上
We'll get him on the first flight out of Nevada

485
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:32,440
再把他随便扔到俄克拉荷马的某个地方
and we'll shove his ass out somewhere over Oklahoma.

486
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:36,590
不管他是不是老年痴呆症 我查了下苏珊·贝利的图片
Alzheimer's or no, I image-searched Susan Bailey

487
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,320
长得是可以一操啊
and she is legit fuckable.

488
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,110
你好 我是丹 请留言
Hi, this is Dan, leave a message.

489
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,180
妈的! 第二件事
Shit! Thing Two.

490
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,960
再说她要价也挺合理的
Honestly, her rates are reasonable.

491
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,090
我是理查德·史培雷呀么我想说
This is Richard Splett, I'm here to say.

496
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:53,940
别废话! 赶紧开车!
Just go! Go, go!

497
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,700
咱们现在就像那个著名电影《盗火线》里面一样
This is like that famous scene from the movie "Heat."

498
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:01,100
你们看过吧 罗伯特·德尼罗和布伦尼曼那一幕
You know, with De Niro and Brenneman.

499
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:03,430
光是想想那一幕我就浑身起鸡皮疙瘩
Just thinking about that scene gives me goose bumps.

500
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,820
这他妈到底什么情况
The fuck is going on?

501
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,340
惠特曼先生 布拉德利先生
Mr. Whitman, sir, I'm sure that Mr. Bradley

502
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,420
一定马上就会回来的
will be right back

503
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,670
马上
very soon.

504
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,260
我现在出去走走
You know, I'm just gonna step out,

505
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:18,890
看看鲍勃是不是还需要什么东西
make sure that Bob doesn't need anything.

506
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,220
马上回来
Be right back.

507
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,590
大家晚上好 在我们开始之前
Good evening, everyone. Before we start,

508
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:29,140
我想先致谢这次晚宴的主办人
I would like to acknowledge the chairman of tonight's dinner

509
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,730
以及这个特殊组织长期的慷慨投资人
and a longtime generous benefactor of this unique institution,

510
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:34,360
查尔斯·贝尔德二世先生

511
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,830
多谢 史蒂夫 我想说大家开吃吧
Thank you, Steve. I'd like to say dig in,

512
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:43,630
但是我的女伴还没到
but my date is running late.

513
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,690
总统都这样 对吧?
Presidents, right?

514
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,770
希望她能在大家老成化石之前尽快赶到
Well, hopefully she arrives before we all turn into fossils.

515
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:53,130
为什么现在所有人都不接电话
Why is nobody answering their phones right now?

516
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:54,850
稍等 女士 我再给丹打个试试
Hang on, ma'am. I'm gonna try Dan again.

我都给你打了百八十个电话了
I've called you like 80 times.

520
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,730
- 总统在线上 - 抱歉女士

惠特曼让我们把手机都关了

523
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:08,350
你什么意思? 会议结束了?
What do you mean? The meeting is over?

524
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,550
还没呢 但这不能阻止我们的雄鹰
Well, no, but that didn't stop the Eagle

525
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,730
飞到街上并坐着出租车离开啊
from flying out onto the street and getting in a cab.

526
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,210
他比松鼠的屎尿都不正常啊[nuttier译疯子和捡坚果两意]
Yeah, turns out he's nuttier than a squirrel's diaper.

527
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,850
- 让乔纳把他的嘴闭上 - 闭嘴
- Tell Jonah to shut the fuck up. - Shut the fuck up.

528
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:19,160
如果会议还在继续的话 谁和惠特曼在一起呢?
If the meeting's still going on, who's with Whitman?

529
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,480
- 是理查德 - 感谢老天
- Richard. - Oh, thank God.

530
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,590
我不是早告诉过你了吗
Hate to say I told you so.

531
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,330
- 他妈闭嘴 - 闭嘴 乔纳
- Shut the fuck up. - Shut the fuck up, Jonah.

532
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,650
史培雷先生 鲍勃·布拉德利在哪?
Mr.Splett, where's Bob Bradley?

533
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,800
老实说 我也正要问你呢
Honestly, I was gonna ask you that.

534
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,710
你能跟我拍张照么?
Do you mind if I get a picture with you

535
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,200
放在我的博客"闲谈史培雷二三事"上

告诉雄鹰 我很高兴见到他
Tell the Eagle it was great to see him.

537

明天晚上六点
and 6:00 P.M. Tomorrow,

538
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:45,200
这个州的每一张选票都将被认证并计数
every vote in this state will be counted and certified.

539
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,300
并不是每一张选票 选举趣味小知识
Well, not every vote. Funny thing about elections,

540
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,380
从历史上看 遗弃选票是客观存在的
historically there've always been leftover ballots.

541
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,220
有时候多达16%的选票会被弄丢或扔掉
Sometimes up to 16% end up missing or thrown out.

542
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:57,340

- Is that what this is about? - I'm so sorry for...

543
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,680
我为瓦肖县的遗失选票感到抱歉
The missing ballots in Washoe County.

544
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,060
我们到处都找了 但还是一无所获
We looked all over for them, came up empty,

545
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,290
所以说 祝你们好运吧
so best of luck to you.

546
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,060
如果你真的碰巧找到了一张新选票的话
And if you do happen to find as much as one new vote,

547
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:09,010
- 咱们法庭见 - 多谢
- we'll see you in court. - Thank you.

548
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,730
我滴个神呀
Holy bacon double Asperger's.

549
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,540
- 你怎么套出话来的? - 抱歉 你说啥?
- How did you do that? - I'm sorry, what?

550
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,260
艾米 说五个你最喜欢的德尼罗的电影
Amy, what are your top five favorite De Niro movies?

551
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,730
除了《拜见岳父大人》
And you can't say "Meet the Parents"

552
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,960
毫无疑问这是最好的
'cause that's automatically number one.

553
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,180
肯特 是瓦肖县 别问我怎么知道的
Kent, it's Washoe County. Don't ask me how I know.

554
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,470
肯特 让司法部来管这事 明白么?
Kent, get the Justice Department on this, okay?

555
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,140
把你的数据都给他们 帮他们缩小范围
You give them your statistical whatever it is to narrow it down.

556
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,730
- 您是说我的记叙数据矩阵 - 对 就是那数据什么的
- You mean my data narrative matrices. - Yeah, the datas.

557
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,230
艾米 还是没有雄鹰的消息么?
Amy, is there any sign of the

558
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,540
难不成他开着割草机横穿美国么?
Eagle or is he crossing America on a lawn mower?

559
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,030
夫人 我们现在迫切需要有人在法庭上
Ma'am, we really ought to get someone in court right away

560
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,220
申请限制令延长最后期限
to file a Hail Mary injunction to extend the deadline,

561
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:43,840
至少拖到我们找到漏掉的选票
someone who can stall till we find the ballots.

562
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,850
我考虑过了
I already thought about that.

563
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,880
不用担心
I've got it covered.

564
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:00,610
然后侍女过来
So the lady-in-waiting came over to us

565
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:02,260
跟我们说 "女王陛下
and she said, "Her Majesty

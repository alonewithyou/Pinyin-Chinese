各位我的支持者们 因你们我才得到了大众选票的多数票
And to the American people who supported me

温蒂和我在找代孕
You know, Wendy and I have been meeting with surrogates.

5

她兴冲冲地要把我的

6
00:00:13,156 --> 00:00:15,179
精子塞给另一个女人 太别扭了
my sperm being in another woman. It's weird.

7
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:17,606
乘着经济改革的东风
For the winds of economic change...

8
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,837

- 总统女士 - 非常感谢
- Madam President. - Thank you very much.

11
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:26,716
为什么我的头发被吹得打圈
Why is my hair all spinning around

12
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,961
这些玩意却和你一样 闲着不动?
and these things, like you, are doing nothin'?

13
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:29,852
很显然风速太快的时候
Apparently they shut the

14
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,924
他们就关掉了风力涡轮
turbines off if the wind speeds are too high.

15
00:00:31,982 --> 00:00:34,101
还来得及把它们改成石油井架吗?
Is it too late to turn them into oil derricks?

16
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,664
女士 坏消息
Ma'am, I just got some really sad news.

17
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:37,554
- 你妈住院了 - 什么?
- Your mother's in the hospital. - What?

18
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:40,632
- 好像是中风 - 又来?
- It looks like a stroke. - Again?

19
00:00:40,862 --> 00:00:42,847
我们可以取消和工程师的见面会
We can eighty-six the meet-and-greet with the engineers.

20
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:44,929
- 应该没大问题 - 为什么?
- That's no problem. - Why?

21
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:47,633
因为你得赶到母亲的床头啊
Because you need to rush to your mother's bedside.

22
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,347
- 是啊 - 好吧 那我...

希望外婆没事
I hope Mee-Maw's okay.

24
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,840
死神都敲了她五次门了
She's been at death's door like five times,

25
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:09,960
- 但她总能恢复元气 - 确实如此
- but she always bounces back to life. - It's true.

26
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:12,309
她就和那个谁一样
She's like that guy... that guy...

27
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,642
- 拉撒路[圣经中被耶稣复活] - 拉斯普金[俄国僧人被暗杀五次才死亡]
- Lazarus. - Rasputin.

28
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:15,963
她上次来白宫的时候看起来特别亲切
She seemed sweet when she visited the White House.

29
00:01:16,078 --> 00:01:17,248
是吗? 我和你们说
Really? Let me tell you something.

30
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:19,838
我第一次竞选州参议员失败后
After I lost my first election for state senate,

31
00:01:20,624 --> 00:01:23,693
妈妈告诉我"这不是你的错
Mother says to me, "Well, it's not your fault.

32
00:01:23,866 --> 00:01:25,381
错的是你露出牙齿的笑容"
It's just your toothy smile."

33
00:01:25,429 --> 00:01:28,392
我的天 我爱死你的笑容啦
Oh, my God. I love your smile.

34
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:29,342
这不是重点
That's not the point.

35
00:01:29,428 --> 00:01:31,126
你不露牙的话更奇怪
Looks weirder if you don't show your teeth.

36
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:33,715
我只是不敢相信
I just cannot believe that this has happened

37
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:35,412
在有这么多事情的时候她病了
in the middle of all of this.

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,577
我懂的 跟你说 我妈妈得卵巢癌的时候...
I know. I know. I'll tell you, when my mom got ovarian cancer...

39
00:01:38,635 --> 00:01:39,555
对了 打给肯特
Oh, call Kent.

40
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:44,130
选票听证会

41
00:01:39,814 --> 00:01:44,130
内华达州最高法院

42
00:01:41,032 --> 00:01:43,152
这正是为什么我们要制止
And that is why we have to stop

43
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:45,943
选举人票选过程中这种草率的干预
this reckless meddling in the electoral process.

44
00:01:46,221 --> 00:01:47,918
坚守法律底线
Stick to the legal deadline

45
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,958
保证选票的公正性
and certify the count as it stands.

46
00:01:51,208 --> 00:01:52,263
谢谢您 法官大人
Thank you, Your Honors.

47
00:01:53,538 --> 00:01:54,670
庭上 请允许我
May it please the court,

48
00:01:55,054 --> 00:01:57,633
我们可以站在法庭上
there are many things that we could all stand here

49
00:01:57,681 --> 00:01:59,599
无休止地就很多事进行辩论
and debate for hours on end.

50
00:01:59,925 --> 00:02:02,803
天是蓝的吗? 水是湿的吗?
Is the sky blue? Is water wet?

51
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,521
但是拘泥于仲裁期限
But isn't it far worse to adhere to an arbitrary deadline

52
00:02:07,703 --> 00:02:10,465
不是比统计所有有效票要糟得多吗?
rather than counting every valid vote?

53
00:02:12,518 --> 00:02:14,896
上帝啊 选举人票选抗议?
Jesus, an electoral protest?

54
00:02:15,865 --> 00:02:19,336
等一下 那是奥布莱恩那边的猎头 选票重计时见过
Wait a second, that's the O'Brien nimrod from the recount table.

55
00:02:19,643 --> 00:02:21,878
假抗议 典型的奥布莱恩式行为
A fake protest. That is classic O'Brien.

56
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:23,508
真他妈卑鄙
It's such a scumbag move.

57
00:02:23,556 --> 00:02:25,283
这无休无尽的选票重计得结束了
this endless recount's got to go.

58
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:29,349
是啊 我要去弄点零钱
Yep, I'll raid petty cash.

59
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,696
贞女医院

60
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,696
马里兰州银春区

61
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,590
夫人 您得看下奥布莱恩这个蠢货的推文
Ma'am, you have to see this dumb O'Brien tweet.

62
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,528
"又是浪费纳税人钱财的一天
"Another day wasting taxpayer dollars.

63
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,887
梅耶风车项目费钱又没用”
Meyer plus windmills cost money, do nothing."

64
00:02:37,117 --> 00:02:38,191
这得怪你 你说呢?
Well, that's on you, isn't it?

65
00:02:38,345 --> 00:02:40,675
风车不转今天你试试脑子转起来好吗?
See if you can spin something right today, okay?

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,440
- 天哪 - 夫人 艾米打电话来了
- God. - Ma'am, Amy's calling.

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,154
艾米 怎么了?

夫人 我感到非常非常抱歉
Ma'am, I'm so, so sorry.

70
00:02:49,824 --> 00:02:52,740
你妈妈 我在赫芬顿邮报上看到她住院了
Your mother. I read on HuffPo that she was in the hospital.

71
00:02:52,864 --> 00:02:55,511
艾米 我还以为你说的是选票重计呢
Amy, I thought you were talking about the recount.

72
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,079
再也不要像这样吓我了
Don't ever, ever scare me like that again.

73
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:01,026
- 不好意思 - 不惜一切代价
- I'm sorry. - Just do whatever it takes

74
00:03:01,074 --> 00:03:02,560
把选票算进去懂了吗?
to get these ballots counted, okay?

00:03:02,714 --> 00:03:04,325
我妈妈会没事的 我得挂了
My mother's gonna be fine. I gotta go.

像她用手挖过土豆一样
Looks like she's been diggin' for potatoes or something.

132
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:09,700
你现在怎么竟然还在操心她的指甲?

133
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,196
这压根不重要

她给我洗澡的时候都戴着洗碗的手套
She always wore dishwashing gloves when she gave me my bath.

136

这好像是我不洗碗的原因
Which is why I don't do dishes.

137
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:20,509
我刚意识到
I just now realized that.

情况相当不妙
I'm afraid it's quite dire.

00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,935
大脑功能全部中断
All brain function has ceased.

144
00:05:36,448 --> 00:05:38,922
所以是她醒不过来的意思?
So she's not gonna bounce back?

00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:41,732
她恐怕得靠维持机维持生命了
I'm afraid she'll need to stay on life support

直至大限之日
until she expires.

147
00:05:44,753 --> 00:05:46,623
你还想帮她修修指甲吗?
Did you still want to do her nails?

148
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:47,908
- 当然 - 好嘞
- Oh, yes, I do. - Okay.

149
00:05:48,254 --> 00:05:51,850
医院餐厅 一楼

150
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,431
不 我们不用那女人
No, we're not hiring that woman.

151
00:05:50,488 --> 00:05:51,975
她嘴上只是感冒疮啊 亲爱的
It was just a cold sore, honey.

152
00:05:52,023 --> 00:05:54,238
我可不想花四万刀换个有疱疹的宝宝[一般为性病]
I don't want to pay 40 grand for a herpes baby.

153
00:05:54,497 --> 00:05:56,463

159
00:06:06,217 --> 00:06:07,674
给你们交代一下我的背景
and give you guys a little background on me.

160
00:06:07,741 --> 00:06:10,177
你们已经知道成功代孕了三个宝宝

我吃用全部是有机的 每天锻炼

你们都是基督徒吗?
Are y'all Christians?

167
00:06:24,170 --> 00:06:25,867
对 对
Yes. Mm-hmm, yes.

168
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:29,291
很多人都觉得我是犹太人 但 不
I mean, a lot of people think that I'm Jewish, but that-- no.

169
00:06:31,046 --> 00:06:32,197
你们都去哪些教堂?
What church y'all go to?

170
00:06:32,686 --> 00:06:34,268
- 圣女... - 圣洁的子宫...

171
00:06:34,316 --> 00:06:36,647
- ...圣洁的子宫 - ...耶稣的子宫

172
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:39,332
就一个小教会 但是挺激进的
It's a small congregation, but it's fierce.

173
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:40,732
很神圣
It's holy.

174
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:43,725
艾米丽正在修她的指甲
Okay, Emily's working on her nails now.

175
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:45,834
- 好 - 打扰一下 总统女士
- Good. - Excuse me, Madam President.

176
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:48,127
您母亲没有决定最后要不要放弃抢救
Your mother was a bit vague on the DNR.

177
00:06:48,184 --> 00:06:49,978
- 好 - 所以要您来决定了
- Okay. - So it will come down to you.

178
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:51,512

迈克普里医生
Well, Dr. McCurry

182
00:06:57,564 --> 00:07:00,172
- 米尔普里 - 对 就这意思
- Mirpuri. - Yes, that's what I said.

183
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:04,056
具体是什么意思呢 要把她维持生命的插头拔了?
So what does that entail, you know, the pulling of the plug?

184
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:06,243
其实没有插头
There's not really a plug.

185
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:09,638
只要去除呼吸机管
What we're talking about requires removing the ventilator tube.

186
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:12,688
然后她的各种器官就会开始衰竭
And then as her organs begin to fail

187
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:15,239
天 我得坐下缓缓
Okay, I'm gonna have to sit down for just a minute,

188
00:07:15,287 --> 00:07:15,785
如果可以的话
if that's all right.

189
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:19,401
我们会持续观察她的生命迹象
We would be tracking her vitals

190
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,885
这没事 凯瑟琳 别担心
It's okay, Catherine. It's okay.

191
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,443
啊 这就有点大声了 亲
Oh, wow, that is loud, honey.

192
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,459
那也忒大声了
That's loud.

193
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:30,094
这"斯蒂芬·霍金"也不舒服了 我还是...
Oh, "Stephen Hawking" Here is indisposed, so I'll just...

194
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:32,626
- 马乔里 你能帮我处理好这档子破事吗? - 好的 女士
- Marjorie, can you help me with this? - Yes, ma'am.

195
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:34,726
我仅想向您保证 总统女士
I just want to assure you, Madam President,

196
00:07:34,774 --> 00:07:36,798
我们将竭尽所能以保证...
we would do everything in our power to ensure

197
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:39,195
等等 这突然有急事 肯特!
Yeah, just a sec. Something's pressing here. Kent!

198
00:07:39,685 --> 00:07:41,612
- 不好意思 不是有意打扰 - 不不不
- I'm sorry, didn't mean to intrude. - No, no, no.

199
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,965
我故意选择了一条别人听不见的地方
I chose a parabolic path deliberately out of earshot.

200
00:07:43,012 --> 00:07:43,425
没事
It's fine.

201
00:07:45,564 --> 00:07:46,110
怎么了?
What's up?

202
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:48,479
我就是想
I just needed to get a

203
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:51,289
从外面那个印度死神那里缓缓
break from the Hindu Grim Reaper out there.

204
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:02,375
我不知道这能不能提供些安慰
I don't know if this provides any solace,

205
00:08:02,452 --> 00:08:06,049
但自从您母亲病危的消息传出
but ever since your mother's health setback was announced,

206
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:09,453
民众一直表现出对您的支持...
there has been an outpouring of support...

207
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:12,973
...也提升了您的受欢迎度
...that has driven up your favorables.

208
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,895
我是在说要不要拔出她的插头
I'm talking about pulling the plug on my mother here.

209
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,226
就0.5%的民调怎么能
How is half a percentage point in the polls

210
00:08:19,274 --> 00:08:21,163
让糟糕的情况好转一点?
supposed to sweeten that shit biscuit?

211
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:22,928
- 上升的可是双位数 - 讲真?
- More like double digits. - Really?

212
00:08:25,258 --> 00:08:26,869
但我就好奇想问问啊
But just out of curiosity,

213
00:08:27,569 --> 00:08:29,181
如果我要 你懂
if I were to, you know...

214
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:33,592
民调上升会停止吗?
uh, would that end?

215
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,949
可能会出现一个短暂的
There is a possibility of a shorter-lived,

216
00:08:36,997 --> 00:08:40,027
更大幅度的上涨
but numerically greater outpouring

217
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,780
可以叫"死亡跳跃"
if you will, a "Death bump."

218
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:44,314
- 讲真? -真
- Really? - Really.

219
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:51,814
真是疯狂而沉重啊
Well, that is some wild and heavy stuff.

220
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:52,428
确实
Indeed.

221
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:55,593
我得好好检索我的灵魂了
Yeah. I got some real soul-searching to do.

222
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:12,625
我已经在华盛顿待了很长时间了
Now, I have been in Washington a long time

223
00:09:12,673 --> 00:09:14,054
我以为我什么都见过了
and I thought I had seen everything,

224
00:09:14,112 --> 00:09:16,902
但是奥布莱恩参议员表现出来的泠漠
but the insensitivity shown by Senator O'Brien

225
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:18,437
很明显说明
clearly demonstrates that this

226
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,873
这个男人并不拥有判断力与尊严...
man does not possess the judgment and dignity...

227
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:22,724
真理啊
True statesman right there.

228
00:09:22,906 --> 00:09:26,301
好的吧 我现在需要一个安静的地方来思考
Okay, so now what I need is a quiet place to think

229
00:09:26,387 --> 00:09:28,258
这地方不能有迈克那张蠢脸
that doesn't have Mike's stupid face in it.

230
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,514
我转身 女士
I can turn around, ma'am.

231
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:31,096
四楼有个小教堂
There's a chapel on the fourth floor.

232
00:09:31,163 --> 00:09:32,573
可以订给您使用
We can make sure it's cleared out for you.

233
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:33,245
好 棒
Okay, yeah.

234
00:09:34,386 --> 00:09:35,268
- 女士? - 怎么?
- Ma'am? - What?

235
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:38,721
我们所爱的永不逝去
Those we have loved cannot be lost

236
00:09:39,382 --> 00:09:41,042
因为他们已经与我们融为一体
because they are always a part of us.

237
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:43,449
谢谢啊 本 顺带感谢写那句话的人
Thank you, Ben, and whoever wrote those words.

238
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,060
- 看我发现了什么 - 晚了

- 当然 - 我记得这句话

天呐 让我看看成品
Jesus Christ. All right, show me the art.

我们有"选举"头头"票"
We got "Count Totes the Votes."

248

这是什么?什么是"头头"?
What is that? What's "Totes"?

249
00:10:04,749 --> 00:10:07,837
"头头" 就像是 统计所有的票
Totes, like all. Count all the votes.

250

你们只有一件工作 就是把人群聚起来
You guys have one job to do, that is to rally the crowd

251
00:10:10,263 --> 00:10:11,290
带着支持总统的标语

252
00:10:11,338 --> 00:10:13,217
让你们不上镜的脸上电视
and get your camera-unfriendly faces on TV.

253
00:10:13,265 --> 00:10:16,200
- 没错 - 你不能让乔纳·瑞安就这样出现在电视上
- Yes. - You can't put a Jonah Ryan on TV like that.

254
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:18,425
18到34岁的女性都会被严重干扰的
18 to 34-year-old women are gonna be distracted by that.

255
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,350
18到34岁的女性如果看到你出现在电视里
The only thing that women 18-34 are gonna do

256
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:23,748
唯一会做的就是申请一份限制令
when they see you on camera is file a restraining order.

257
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:25,973
所以制造点动静吧 笨蛋们
So make some fuckin' noise, dummies.

258

- 可能会引起一些咳嗽 - 哦
- there might be some coughing. - Oh.

296
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,900
就是一种反射反应 并不表示她醒了
It's reflexive. It's not a sign that she's aware

297
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:05,425
- 或是很痛苦之类的 - 好的
- or suffering in any way. - Okay.

So...

306

00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:23,721
女士 我们在这不合适吧
Ma'am, I don't really think we should be here for this.

314
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:25,006
你们留下 留下

你怎么不看看你的手机呢?
Well, why don't you check your phones?

332
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:36,282
听起来就像你偷了好多振动棒一样
Sounds like you shoplifted a bunch of vibrators.

Don't eat the bananas. They're wax.

439
00:18:48,289 --> 00:18:50,188
- 收到 - 内华达来了坏消息
- Copy that. - Shit news from Nevada.

440
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:53,516
- 什么? - 新的票数倾向奥布莱恩
- What? - The new votes are tilting heavily toward O'Brien.

441
00:18:53,775 --> 00:18:56,882
显然他们大都是缺席的军人选举人票
Apparently most of them are military absentees.

442
00:18:57,112 --> 00:19:00,708
当然了 达顿堡 这就都说得通了
Of course. Fort Dutton. It all makes sense.

443
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:03,135
不不不不 一点都说不通
No, no, no. That doesn't make any sense.

444
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,600
内达华是支持我的 我才应该是总统
Nevada is my state. I'm gonna be president.

445
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,438
我要成为史上选举出的第一位总统女士
I'm gonna be the first elected lady president.

446
00:19:08,515 --> 00:19:10,961
我会有个特别棒的就职典礼 到时候会有比利·乔给我唱歌
I'm gonna have a lovely inauguration. Billy Joel is gonna sing.

447
00:19:11,104 --> 00:19:13,895
所以你们必须马上停止票数重计
So you guys have to stop the recount.

448
00:19:14,317 --> 00:19:15,641
- 等一下 你说什么? - 停止计票
- I'm sorry, what? - Stop the count.

449
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:18,326
- 盖瑞 闭嘴 女士 这不行 - 我不管
- Shut up, Gary. Ma'am, we can't. - I don't care.

450
00:19:18,432 --> 00:19:19,486
火车已经大庭广众之下驶离站点
The train has very publically

451
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,539
而且高速运行了
left the station and derailed at high speed.

452
00:19:21,606 --> 00:19:22,929
- 你必须停止计票 - 女士
- You got to stop the count. - Ma'am,

453
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,848
这简直是个180度大转弯啊
this would look like a size-14 flip-flop.

454
00:19:24,876 --> 00:19:26,181
- 我们真的不能... - 我他妈不管!
- We really can't... - I don't give a fuck!

455
00:19:26,967 --> 00:19:29,806
你要像安妮·弗兰克的犹太成人礼一样取消票数重计
You're gonna cancel this recount like Anne Frank's bat mitzvah.

456
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:32,836
好的 马上就办 虽然我觉得已经来不及了
Yeah, I'm on it, though I think the DJ already spent the deposit.

457
00:19:33,268 --> 00:19:36,625
现在就办... 喂 艾米 是的
I'm on it right... yeah, Amy. Yeah.

458
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:38,044
我已经受够失败了!
I'm tired of losing things!

459
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:41,899
我们提出申请 希望后来找到的票数
We would like to file a motion to exclude

460
00:19:41,938 --> 00:19:43,923
可以全部作废
all pending ballots from the recount.

461
00:19:45,572 --> 00:19:48,325
柯林斯小姐 你知道你现在说的话
Ms. Collins, you do realize that what you're saying

462
00:19:48,344 --> 00:19:51,480
和昨天完全相反么?
is in diametric opposition to the case you presented yesterday?

463
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,341
既然最后期限已过
If the deadline has passed,

464
00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:55,566
为何要允许继续计票呢?
why is the recount allowed to continue?

465
00:19:55,863 --> 00:19:59,373
反对 法官大人 必须继续计票
Objection, Your Honor. The count must continue.

466
00:19:59,881 --> 00:20:02,097
我们告诉"傻蛋 蠢蛋 奸蛋"
Did we tell "Huey, Dewey, and Rapey"

467
00:20:02,183 --> 00:20:04,830
现在的口号是"停止计票"而不是"票数重计"了么?
that it's "Stop the Count" Now and not "Count Every Vote"?

468
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:06,767
该死的
Shit.

469
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:10,421
票数重计 票数重计
Count every vote. Count every vote.

470
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:13,327
票数重计 票数重计
Count every vote. Count every vote.

471
00:20:13,365 --> 00:20:14,497
他不是奥布莱恩那边的么?
Doesn't he work for O'Brien?

472
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:18,256
当然不是了 天呐 快点喊吧 理查德
No. Jesus. Come on, Richard, no.

473
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,865
- 票数重计! - 乔纳!
- Count every vote! - Jonah!

474
00:20:21,594 --> 00:20:22,975
- 票数重计! - 理查德!
- Count every vote! - Richard!

475
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:25,209
快别喊了 你俩傻缺!
Stop protesting, you idiots!

476
00:20:26,543 --> 00:20:29,324
票数重计! 票数重计!
Count every vote! Count every vote!

477
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:32,594
让我被暗杀吧
Maybe I'll get assassinated.

478
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:38,569
三一圣公教堂

479
00:20:33,611 --> 00:20:38,569
马里兰 肯伍德

480
00:20:37,054 --> 00:20:39,777
赛琳娜 赛琳娜 赛琳娜
Selina, Selina, Selina.

481
00:20:39,912 --> 00:20:42,405
- 干嘛? - 人生充满起伏
- What? - Life takes so many turns.

482
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:44,985
- 是的 - 我希望你明白我的心意
- Yeah. - I just want you to know where I'm coming from.

483
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,351
- 好吧 - 莫妮卡是可爱的
- All right. - Monica, she's sweet,

484
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,806
她很贴心 但她只是暂时的
she's lovely, she's short-term.

485
00:20:50,941 --> 00:20:53,261
她只是目前伴我度过漫漫长夜的人
She's something to get me through the long nights for now.

486
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:56,618
安德鲁 你知道现在是葬礼 对吧?
Andrew, you know that we're at a funeral, right?

487
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:58,411
- 我们不是在地中海俱乐部度假 - 在我心里...
- We're not at Club Med. - In here...

488
00:20:59,064 --> 00:21:00,493
从来都是你
it's always been you.

489
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:05,518
在教堂里
In a church.

490
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,887
- 总统女士 - 汤姆
- Madam President. - Oh, Tom.

491
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:09,968
- 深表遗憾 请节哀 - 谢谢你
- I'm so sorry for your loss. - Thank you very much.

492
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:11,809
感谢你能前来 汤姆 我十分感激
Thanks for being here, Tom. I appreciate it.

493
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:13,986

是啊 他一大早飞过来的
Yes. Yeah, he flew in this morning.

495
00:21:16,796 --> 00:21:19,184
那么此时此刻的美国经济靠谁挽救呢?
So who's fisting the American economy while he's here?

496
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:20,949
你是认真的吗 汤姆?
Really, Tom?

497
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:23,059
抱歉 总统女士
My apologies, Madam President.

498
00:21:23,471 --> 00:21:24,632

Wow, your ex, not afraid to mix business with mourning.

504
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,166
对啊 他见到你多久之后就
Oh, yeah. How soon after meeting you

505
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,104
开始推销他近期的投资计划了?
did he ask you to invest in his latest venture?

506
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:41,108
- 足足有17秒 我掐了表的 - 真的吗?
- 17 seconds. I timed it. - Really?

507
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:42,642
一些只赚不亏的
Some can't-lose scheme

508
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:45,174
巴西第三大连锁酒店的投资计划
about the third largest hotel chain in Brazil.

509
00:21:45,491 --> 00:21:46,881
- "只赚不亏" - 只赚不亏啊
- "Can't lose." - Can't lose.

510
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:48,051
我得去看看我钱包还在不在了
Got to see if I still have my wallet.

511
00:21:49,231 --> 00:21:50,871
- 夫人 恕我打扰一下 - 好的?

512
00:21:50,948 --> 00:21:52,578
- 悼词都准备好了 - 好的
- The eulogy is all set. - Okay.

513
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:54,832
- 附上那个关于弹钢琴的小故事 - 可谓完美
- And I added the good piano anecdote. - Perfect.

514
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:56,683
- 这应该不太好吧... - 没事儿 能成
- I don't know if that was the best... - No, it works.

515
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:58,639
安德鲁
Andrew.

516
00:21:59,761 --> 00:22:01,507
请问我能参加那个巴西投资不?
Can anybody get in on this Brazil thing?

517
00:22:01,593 --> 00:22:02,792
我还得花钱买个娃
I got a baby to pay for.

518
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,170
拜托让我放那首蒂姆·麦格罗的曲子
Please let me play the Tim McGraw song.

519
00:22:05,448 --> 00:22:06,570
行吗? 都准备好了
Okay? I have it all cued up.

520
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,664
讲真 凯瑟琳
Seriously, Catherine,

521
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:09,754
这是场悼念会 不是纳斯卡车赛[一场收视率奇高的美国汽车赛事]
this is a funeral, not a NASCAR race.

522
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:11,414
我没时间给你倒腾这个
I don't have the time for this right now.

523
00:22:11,452 --> 00:22:13,332
那您什么时候才有时间 妈? 什么时候?
When do you have the time, then, Mom? When?

524
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:16,190
- 小点声 - 好吧 因为你不喜欢蒂姆·麦格罗
- Shh. - Okay? Because you don't like Tim McGraw,

525
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,683
所以人人就不该喜欢蒂姆·麦格罗了
then nobody is supposed to like Tim McGraw.

526
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:20,515
凯瑟琳 你再也不准
Catherine, you are forbidden

527
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:23,737
提"蒂姆·麦格罗"了
from saying the words "Tim McGraw" Ever again.

528
00:22:23,862 --> 00:22:25,780
太不可理喻了 外婆说你说得太对了
Unbelievable. Mee-Maw was so right about you.

529
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,909
- 你说这话什么意思? - 打扰了 女士
- What is that supposed to mean? - Pardon me, ma'am.

530
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,057
- 打扰一下 能耽误你几分钟时间吗? - 什么?
- Pardon me. Could I borrow you for a minute? - What?

531
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,465
我刚刚跟卡塔尔的大使
I've just been kibitzing with the Qatari ambassador,

532
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,783
默罕默德·本·纳萨尔·本·哈里发·阿里·贾法尔聊了一下
Mohammed bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Jaffar.

533
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,212
千万别让他签宾客册
Please don't have him sign the guest book.

534
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,120
好的 他带来了一条中国方面的消息
Yeah, he comes bringing a message from China.

535
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:41,029
为什么中国会在卡塔尔掺一脚?
Why would China go through Qatar?

536
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,458
卡塔尔乐意给他们掺和
Qataris love to insert themselves.

537
00:22:42,496 --> 00:22:44,874
- 他们想进行肮脏的PY交易 - 肛交了?
- They're wet-fingered. - They're into ass play?

538
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:48,960
不 他们对感知官场的盛行风气很有一套
No, they have a gift for sensing prevailing political winds.

539
00:22:49,238 --> 00:22:50,782
他们肯定也喜欢肛交
I'll bet they're into ass play, too.

540
00:22:51,108 --> 00:22:52,739
你带进来的那些人
Those people that you bring in,

541
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:55,673
最后会带来新的人 如此以往 你就会从中得到分红
as they bring in people, you get a piece of that.

542
00:22:55,731 --> 00:22:56,383
我会得到分红
I get a piece of that.

543
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,605
源源不绝
In perpetuity.

544
00:23:00,257 --> 00:23:02,032
- 总统女士 - 大使先生
- Madam President. - Mr. Ambassador.

545
00:23:02,636 --> 00:23:04,861
我知道你有则消息要捎给我
So I understand you have a message for me.

546
00:23:05,139 --> 00:23:07,872
- 我要说的内容是严格保密的 - 嗯哼
- What I say to you is in the strictest of confidence. - Mm-hmm.

547
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,510
您扬言对我们的中国朋友进行制裁
The sanctions you have threatened against our friends in China

548
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:12,428
这会给中国泡沫经济造成巨大的负面影响
may undermine their very fragile economy

549
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,259
特别是在经济如此不景气的当下
at a most inopportune moment.

550
00:23:14,835 --> 00:23:18,623
但是 用减轻经济压力做交换
But in exchange for easing the economic pressure,

551
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:22,689
他们愿意开展一次间接谈话
they would be open to indirect talks.

552
00:23:24,128 --> 00:23:26,084
都谈些什么呢?
What is on the table?

553
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:27,792
噢 几乎所有
Oh, everything.

554
00:23:28,453 --> 00:23:30,870
从气候变化到人权主义
From climate change to human rights.

555
00:23:31,302 --> 00:23:32,443
请您与我保持联系
We shall be in touch.

556
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:34,514
谢谢您 大使阿里...
Thank you, Ambassador Al...

557
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:36,854
好的
Okay.

558
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:41,477
神秘啊?
Well, that was mysterious, right?

559
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,453
- 女士 他们都在等着你呢 - 嗯?
- Ma'am. They're ready for you. - Yeah?

560
00:23:43,568 --> 00:23:44,862
开场吧
Let's get this show on the road.

561
00:23:45,313 --> 00:23:47,183
今天 我们聚集在这里
We are gathered together today

562
00:23:47,605 --> 00:23:50,032
是为了铭记凯瑟琳·卡尔弗特·伊顿的一生
to remember the life of Catherine Calvert Eaton.

563
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:53,120
这个中国的事应该是个名流千古的机会是吧?
This China thing is like legacy material, right?

564
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:56,352
或者是让我得诺贝尔和平奖的那种
Nobel Peace Prize material.

565
00:24:03,314 --> 00:24:03,995
什么?
What?

566
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:06,729
我等下再告诉你
I'll tell you after.

567
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,138
现在就告诉我
Tell me now.

568
00:24:09,423 --> 00:24:11,073
凯伦阻止不了计票
Karen couldn't stop the count.

569
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:13,605
我们正式输了内华达
We officially lost Nevada,

570
00:24:13,643 --> 00:24:15,485
所以我们必须在国会上赢回来
so we're gonna have to fight it out in Congress.

571
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,988
- 还有... - 还有什么?
- And... - And what?

572
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:18,860
还有啥?
What else?

573
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,188
鉴于新的投票数都流向了奥布莱恩 我们...
With all the new votes going to O'Brien, we've...

574
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,679
肯特你来说
Kent.

575
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,662
我们也失去了大众选票
We lost the popular vote.

576
00:24:29,045 --> 00:24:29,861
哦天啊
Oh, God.

577
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:37,207
我很抱歉 女士
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

578
00:24:38,271 --> 00:24:39,556
节哀
Sorry for your loss.

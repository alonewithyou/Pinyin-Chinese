00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,920
华盛顿特区维拉德酒店

2
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,920
感恩节前一天

3
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,920
上午 9:00

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,720
时间到了
It's time.

5
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,140
白宫玫瑰园

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,140
上午 10:03

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,640
一直以来感恩节意味着
Thanksgiving has always meant sharing the bounty

8
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,860
享用这片沃土给我们的奖赏
of our rich land,

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,530
尤其是火鸡
especially turkey.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,100
不过今年的感恩节上我们不会分享的
But the one thing we will not be sharing this holiday

11
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,340
是鸡腿和蔓越橘[总统赦免火鸡仪式]
is Drumstick or Cranberry.

12
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,400
两个名字是
Catherine actually

13
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:44,220
凯瑟琳亲自起的 对不对啊亲爱的?
personally chose those names, didn't you, honey?

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,120
- 嗯 是的 - 没错
- Um, yes, I did. - Yes, she did.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,350
再告诉我点这两只火鸡的情况
Help me get a few more details

16
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,630
我到时可以拿来应付媒体
about these turkeys that I can maybe give the press.

17
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,880
他们今晚回酒店会不会一起去吧台喝点小酒啊?
Like are they gonna hit the minibar tonight at their hotel?

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,980
酒店房间我们确实预定了好几天
Well, we booked the hotel for a few nights,

19
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,900
不过庆典之后我就要把这俩家伙直接带到
but I'm taking these guys straight to a petting zoo

20
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,050
弗吉尼亚的小动物园去了
in Virginia after the ceremony.

21
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:01,870
他们去那安度余生了吧
Oh, they can while away the rest of their peaceful years there.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,420
它们就是养来被吃的 估计过一两年
Well, they were bred to be eaten, so they'll probably collapse

23
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,120
就撑不住自己体重死掉了
from their own weight and die in a year or two, tops.

24
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,660
这结局能修饰得美好一点吗?
Is there a more fun way to say that?

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,670
以我被赋予的权力
With the power vested in me,

26
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,880
我在此宣布鸡腿和蔓越橘
I hereby declare Drumstick and Cranberry

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,590
赦免于感恩节的餐桌上
pardoned from the Thanksgiving dinner table

28
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:23,860
以及逃税的惩罚中
and also for tax evasion.

29
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:27,140
这就行了吧
There we go.

30
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,260
他们想飞走啊
I think they're trying to fly away.

31
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,950
这些鸟可真脏
Ooh, these birds are filthy.

32
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,060
- 丹 - 我怎么还进不去了?
- Dan. - Hey, why have I been greened?

33
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,000
- 你能不能跟那位朋友说一下... - 别激动
- Will you tell our friend over here... - Take it easy.

34
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,840
不过是安全部门的一点小问题
It's just a screwup with the security office.

35
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,140
有人因为蓝色证件蓝色丁丁闹脾气呢[指性欲不满造成的睾丸胀痛]
Someone's got a case of the blue badge blue balls.

36
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,170
我把你分配到汤姆·詹姆斯那边去
I'm gonna assign you to Tom James' office.

37
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,890
自从我们在国会宣战以后他们就有点人手不足了
They're shorthanded since we're duking it out with Congress.

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,910
我带他进去 他是个乖宝宝
I'll escort him in. He's harmless.

39
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,100
除非你有个妹妹
Unless you got a sister.

40
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,280
你期待感恩节么 马乔里?
You looking forward to Thanksgiving, Marjorie?

41
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,940
- 当然了 女士 - 你在哪过节呢?
- Oh, yes, ma'am. - Where do you spend the holiday?

42
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,760
- 在马里兰 女士 - 我就是从那来的
- In Maryland, ma'am. - Oh, that's where I'm from.

43
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:57,940
我知道 女士
I know, ma'am.

44
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,680
行了 告诉国会议员普锐斯
Okay, so tell Congressman Price

45
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,180
我刚赦免了他臭哄哄的火鸡
I just pardoned his stanky-ass turkeys,

46
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,420
所以国会投票的时候
so I'm gonna expect him to wrap up

47
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,560
他最好搞定密苏里代表团 行么?
that Missouri delegation when the House votes, right?

48
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,370
一步好棋 女士
Well played, ma'am.

49
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,040
密苏里是国内最大的火鸡生产州了
Missouri's the largest turkey-producing state in the union.

50
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,930
- 仅次于北卡罗开纳州 在明尼苏达州之前 - 女士
- Second only to Minnesota followed by North Carolina. - Ma'am.

51
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,700
还有阿肯色州
And Arkansas.

52
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,040
也许我可以赦免个安全气囊有缺陷的汽车...
Maybe I can pardon a car with a defective airbag...

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,290
这样密歇根就搞定了[指密歇根通用汽车气囊问题]
and we can wrap up Michigan.

54
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:21,010
实际上密歇根是最大的蓄电池酸液生产州
Michigan is actually the largest producer of battery acid.

55
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,800
能不能来个人
Can somebody reach around

56
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,350
把肯特的电放了?[机器人肯特梗]
the back of Kent's head and power him down?

57
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,840
女士 财政部的最新数据
Oh, ma'am, latest from Treasury

58
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:27,420
住房开工率下降 失业率上升
is housing starts are down and unemployment's up.

59
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,820
能不能把换一下?
Any chance we can switch those?

60
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:30,380
我只能把这图倒过来
I'll turn the graphs upside down.

61
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,050
对了 明天还有这周末我都用不着你
Oh, listen, I'm not gonna need you this weekend or tomorrow,

62
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,200
- 你就先放个假 - 好极了
- so you can take that off, okay? - Oh, fantastic.

63
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,040
我和我老公正好邀请他家人过来吃火鸡呢
My husband and I are having his whole family over for turkey.

64
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,240
老公? 你结婚了?
Husband? You're married?

65
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,980
是啊 去年就结了
Yes. Last year.

66
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,860
请了250个人 都不是工作上的朋友
250 people, no one from work.

67
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,580
妈 我能和你说句话么?
Mom, can I have a sec?

68
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,380
- 私下说? - 当然了 亲爱的
- Privately? - Sure, honey.

69
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,380
- 什么事? - 好吧
- What is it? - Okay.

70
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,270
我正要去见爸爸和莫妮卡
Well, I was just gonna go meet Dad and Monica.

71
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,940
想来问问你什么时候到
I was just wondering what time you'll be arriving.

72
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,210
亲爱的 我去不了
Oh, honey, I can't.

73
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,670
可这是外婆去世后的第一个感恩节啊
But it's the first Thanksgiving since Mee-maw's gone.

74
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,520
那是挺值得感恩的
There's a lot to be thankful for.

75
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,380
可是我们要在外婆的房子里吃一顿纪念她啊
But we're doing a whole dinner at her house.

76
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:10,020
我是说... 好吧 我的房子里
I mean, it... or, well, my house.

77
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,380
么说还是好奇怪
God, it still sounds so weird saying that.

78
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:14,000
是挺奇怪的
Yeah, it really does.

79
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,290
可是我必须在这啊宝贝
But I have to be here, sweetie pie,

我需要和那些国会议员们打电话
cause I've got to call all of these Congress people.

拉选票 你明白的 妈咪需要拉票啊
Whip the vote. You understand that. Mommy's got to whip.

- Whip it good. What is that? - Devo.

83
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,530
可是你在哪打电话不都是一样的吗?
Well, can't you make those phone calls from anywhere?

84
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,700
- 不一样 必须在华盛顿才行 - 没错
- Nope, it's got to be Washington. - Right.

85
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,010
让人知道她是从白宫总统办公室
It makes a big difference

86
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,490
打电话来的 效果还是不一样的
to know that she's calling from the Oval.

87
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,030
白宫的来电显示不是短号吗?
But doesn't it just come up as unlisted?

88
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,690
不显示地域只显示202之类的啊
They're like 202 or something?

89
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,250
妈 这儿就是著名的白宫食堂
Mom, so this is the famous White House mess.

90
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,290
- 太好了 小乔纳 - 是啊
- Oh, very nice, Joni. - Yeah, isn't it?

在1951年这里被重新修整过...
So this was renovated in 1951 by...

92
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,140
等我一下

马上就回来
Okay, just one second.

94
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,900
这不是柑橘鸡肉沙拉么?
Ooh, is that the mandarin chicken salad?

95
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,920
看着很好吃啊 我能看下你的证件吗?
Looks delicious. Hey, can I see your badge?

96
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,850
我锈迹斑斑的警长证么?
My rusty sheriff's badge?

97
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,700
在你一般去的地方
Oh, I'm sure that showing your

98
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,870
露出菊花绝对让你更受欢迎[指丹很混蛋Asshole]
anus gets you into all your regular social clubs,

99
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,170
不过这里是白宫餐厅 想呆在这
but this is the White House mess and to be in here,

100
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,880
你得有这个蓝色的小宝贝
you got to have one of these blue bad boys.

101
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,260
你干嘛啊 乔纳?
Why are you doing this, Jonah?

102
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,100
你看见那边格罗·弗克利夫兰的照片了吗?
You see the picture of Grover Cleveland?

103
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,970
他眼中的泪水
Is that a tear in his eye

104
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,430
是不是因为规则没有被尊重啊?
because he knows the rules aren't being respected?

105
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,610
我天 操你妈
Oh, Jesus. Fuck you.

106
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,550
不好意思 先生 这边有个闯入者
Excuse me, sir. We have an intruder here.

107
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,260
不 乔纳
No, we don't. You know, Jonah,

108
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,500
我希望你是吸狗屌
I hope you die a horrible death

109
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,170
被噎住惨死的
choking on a red, glistening dog dick.

110
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,470
- 感恩节快乐 瑞安夫人 - 你也是啊
- Have a lovely Thanksgiving, Mrs. Ryan. - Oh, you, too.

111
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,020
- 要是你准备好了我们就走吧 - 干嘛去?
- Well, I'm ready if you are. - For what?

112
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,760
我邀请了理查德和我们一起回去过感恩节
I invited Richard to come back with us for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

113
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,540
老妈 你不能随便邀请我的朋友回去过感恩节
Mom, you don't invite my friends to Thanksgiving dinner.

114
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,810
我才能邀请我的朋友一起过感恩节
I invite my friends to Thanksgiving dinner.

115

理查德 你愿意来我们家吃感恩节晚餐么?

- 他们就等我了吧? - 是的
- Are they ready for me? - Yeah.

120
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,160
这个选举对我太残忍了
It's this election has just been brutal on me.

121
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,560
我的眼皮完全像是
My eyelids are seriously

122
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,820
基思·理查兹下垂的蛋蛋一样
starting to look like Keith Richards' ball sack.

123
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,960
瞎说 他求之不得呢
Oh, please. He wishes.

124
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,680
夫人 迈克刚才向媒体发布了消息
Ma'am, Mike just announced to the press

说为了庆祝感恩节白宫对外界闭馆

朝鲜的军事演习 就这些
a North Korean military exercise right now and that's about it.

128
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,990
我滴娘啊 演习这么频繁
God, all that exercising and Glorious Leader

129
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,800
也没见着三胖领导瘦一点儿啊 是吧?
still can't seem to take off a pound, right?

130
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:06,340
他的拉风发型也在帮倒忙
That haircut's not doing him any favors.

131
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:09,310
韩国总统要求和您通几分钟电话
The South Korean PM is asking for a few minutes to discuss.

132
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,330
疾控中心又上报了几起关于

133

我没事儿 谢谢
I'm fine, thank you.

144
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,220
我得承认 我有点儿紧张
I'm just a little nervous, I have to confess.

145
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:37,530
- 一切都会很好 - 好的
- You're gonna be fine. - Yeah.

146
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,740
您不会有问题的 我一般做的手术都
You're gonna be fine, ma'am. In fact, I usually perform

147
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,690
比去眼袋复杂得多
things that are a bit more complicated than a De-bagging.

148
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,460
你是说去眼袋吧?
A De-bagging? Is that what you just said?

149
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,830
我以为你说了去蛋蛋[字面:茶包]
I thought you said tea-bagging.

150
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,630
不不 泡茶是我的专长
No, no, no. That's my department.

151
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,630
他说的是字面意思 他不知道另外的意思[tea-bagging指将阴囊放入他人口中]
He means that literally. He doesn't know what the other thing is.

152
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,680
总而言之 你能不能
Anyway, listen, can you just

153
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,890
再跟我讲解一下这次手术?
talk me through this procedure one more time?

154
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,290
很简单的
It's quite simple. I actually

155
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,400
我不会在你的外部真皮动刀
don't have to make any cuts to the exterior dermis.

156
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:01,010
是直接从眼皮后方切入
It's all approached internally from behind the eyelid.

157
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,220
可能术后会有肿胀现象
There's gonna be a little swelling

158
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,420
当然也会有点淤青出现
and of course a tiny bit of bruising afterwards.

159
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:06,700
- 啊 淤青? - 是的 淤青
- Ooh, bruising? - Yes, Gary, bruising.

160
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,900
是皮肤下面的一点点的血块淤积
That's when a little blood collects underneath the skin.

161
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,360
在专业医生眼里这些都不是事儿
It's not a problem for an actual doctor.

162
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,720
这个手术的好处就是
Now, the beauty of this procedure

163
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,770
今天做完 周一你就能恢复了
is that we can do it today and you'll be healed by Monday.

164
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,130
而且我看起来年轻10岁
And I'll look 10 years younger.

165
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,500
年轻十岁你就变婴儿啦
That would make you a baby.

166
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,730
- 够了 - 我们开始吧?
- Okay, it's - Shall we get started?

167
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,870
- 好的 - 盖瑞 不好意思请回避
- Okay. Yeah. - Gary, if you'll please excuse us.

168
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,860
我就坐在那儿我会很乖的
It's very easy for me just to sit right there.

169
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,610
- 我知道了 - 真的很乖哟
- I've got it. - Easy.

170
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,470
官方消息称
Officials are reporting a

171
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,870
白宫西翼

172
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,870
下午 12:16

173
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,850
- 沙门氏病菌爆发... - 你看这个报道没?
- salmonella outbreak... - You seeing this?

174
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:35,670
沙门氏菌病爆发
4州报告37起感染案例

175
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:35,710
...已经导致四个州出现37名患者住院治疗
...that has led to 37 hospitalizations in four states.

176
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,150
总统还在为自己的脸做永久PS呢
POTUS is still getting permanently Photoshopped.

177
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:41,410
得让疾病防控中心的领导站出来控制局面
Let's get the head of the CDC out there, calm everyone down.

178
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:44,860
也让汤姆·詹姆斯出来 他是瓶人形抗焦虑药 胡扯界大佬
Let's send Tom James out as well. He's a tall drink of Xanax.

179
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,090
生病人群数量是达不到
The number of people taken ill is

180
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,530
统计显著性的量级
orders of magnitude below statistical significance.

181
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,560
人们都不懂非参数统计吗?
Do people not understand basic nonparametric statistics?

182
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,870
也他妈不懂怎么把火鸡烤熟了
Or how to cook a fucking turkey.

183
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,820
先生 您在这儿
Oh, sir, you're here now. Good.

184
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,680
- 本告诉我... - 我们被派遣了
- So Ben told me that apparently... - We're being deployed.

185
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,170
执行 去你妈的冷静点 任务
Operation Calm the Fuck Down.

186
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,070
- 是的 - 进来吧
- Yes. - Come on in.

187
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,420
正想找你呢
Just the guy I wanted to see.

188
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,820
我知道这个号码
Ooh, uh-oh. I know that number.

189
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,230
是西德尼·珀塞尔那个禽兽的
The number of the beast Sidney Purcell.

190
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,610
我不知道为啥他总打我电话
I don't know why he keeps calling me.

191
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,310
他对别烦我这种潜台词的理解能力
His comprehension of the word no

192
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,620
就像是个喝醉酒的大学四分卫的水准
hovers somewhere around drunk college quarterback level.

193
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:19,070
但是我要怎么帮助您呢?
But anyway, sir, how can I help you?

194
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,260
给你准备了个东西
Got a little something for you.

195
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,000
人事部的卡罗尔欠我个人情
Carol in personnel owed me a favor.

196
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,060
这东西可以把乔纳·瑞安脸上恶心的假笑刷下来了
Oh, this is gonna wipe that crooked smile off Jonah Ryan's face.

197
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,310
我感觉它天生就笑得恶心
I think that's genetic.

198
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,840
伊根你知道吗 我和总统的风格不同
You know, Egan, I work a little differently than the president.

199
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,180
至少在对待下属方面 我可不像个
As far as treating my staff, I try not to act

200
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,730
刚踩到乐高玩具的醉酒老爸
like an alcoholic father who has just stepped on a Lego.

201
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,040
我信奉开明和坦率
I value openness and straight talk.

202
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,810
你现在是詹姆斯团队的一员了
You're part of the James team now.

203
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,680
- 是我圈内的人了 - 我很荣幸
- Part of my inner circle. - I'm honored.

204
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,250
举起你的右手跟我一起宣誓
So raise your right hand and repeat the oath.

205
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,290
我逗你的 走吧
I'm fucking with you. Come on, let's go.

206
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,810
真幽默 先生
That's very good, sir.

207
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,330
- 迈克!迈克! - 这次的沙门氏病菌是流行性的吗?
- Mike! Mike! - Mike, is this a salmonella epidemic?

208
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,640
总统会出面发言吗?
Is the president going to make a statement?

209
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,910
她很快就会出面发言
She will be making a full statement soon--

210
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,730
比你们想的要快 但她得做点准备
sooner than you think, but only when she's ready.

211
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,370
而现在有请出来自疾病防控中心的
Right now, though, I'd like to bring up Dr. Robert Weinberg

212
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,020
罗伯特·温伯格医生 温伯格医生有请
from the Centers for Disease Control. Dr. Weinberg.

213
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,010
- 真糟糕 - 没关系的
- This is not good. - It's fine.

214
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,420
大家都在看球赛 再说只有几例感染
Everybody's watching football. There's only a couple cases.

215
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,660
不 温蒂发飙了
No, Wendy's pissed.

216
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:19,530
她一个人在家应付她父母我父母 还有她孩子
I left her at home with her folks and my folks plus her kids.

217
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:22,180
妈的 我都不知道我家里有谁
Shit, I don't even know who's at my house.

218
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,080
我都不知道他们是不是在城里
I don't even know if they're in town.

219
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:26,910
我不想承认 但是有时候
I hate to admit it, but sometimes

220
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,580
我真怕温蒂
I'm scared of Wendy.

221
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,540
不过她还是胸器动人
She still has a great rack, though.

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,340
- 看起来怎么样? - 很不错 总统女士
- What do you think? - Oh, yeah. You did great, ma'am.

223
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:38,320
- 那就好 - 打扰一下 女士
- Oh, good. - Excuse me, ma'am.

224
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,820
- 你们好啊 - 她是不是美呆了?
- Hi, guys. - Doesn't she look amazing?

225
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:43,740
我滴妈 你就跟个搞砸了丈夫晚餐的
Jesus, you look like a southern housewife

226
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,000
南方家庭妇女似的[南部家暴梗]
who just burned her husband's dinner.

227
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:47,430
夫人 沙门氏病菌爆发引起了轩然大波
Ma'am, the salmonella outbreak has mushroomed.

已经超过200人感染
The cases now number over 200.

229
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,490
我的天 你在逗我吗?
Oh, my God. Are you kidding?

230
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,990
- 我要讲话吗? - 不 这可不是个好主意
- Should I make a statement? - Ben: No, that's not a good idea.

231
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:57,770
您的脸腌好之前还是不要见人了
No one should see you while your face is... marinating.

232
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,280
拜托 她的眼睛刚刚被拿走了十年
Okay, she just had 10 years taken off her eyes.

233
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,970
- 是的 - 我觉得这十年还没走干净
- Yes. - Well, I don't think they left yet.

234
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,860
你就先别出现 好吗? 谨遵医嘱 对吧?
You just stay hidden, okay? Doctor's orders, right?

235
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,940
你问他干嘛? 他又不是医生
What are you asking him for? He's not a doctor.

236
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,740
他都没有啥拿得出手的文聘证书
I mean, he doesn't have any academic qualifications to speak of.

237
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,740
我可是有着康乃尔大学酒店管理
Well, I have a bachelor's degree in hotel management

238
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,470
- 学士学位的人 - 你才没有呢
- from Cornell University. - No, you don't.

239
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,420
或许我们得让副总统去做个声明
Maybe we should ask the vice president to make a statement.

240
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,990
不! 别拿他那张老脸出去丢人了
No! He's the old face of this administration.

241
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:26,430
- 这才是政府的新面孔 - 美丽的面孔
- This is the new face. - It's a beautiful face.

242
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:27,500
你懂我...
Well, you know...

243
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,680
那我们去问问道尔吧?
So may we go ahead and ask Doyle?

244
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,670
好吧
All right, fine.

245
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,840
翻起白眼来好疼
It really hurts to roll my eyes.

246
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,150
好 让道尔去
Okay, yes, ask Doyle.

247
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,860
但别告诉他为什么
But don't tell him why.

248
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,720
没事的 没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

249
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,570

和收割的蔬菜 比如玉米 西葫芦

257

他们还是会冲爷爷吼[过节亲戚矛盾梗]

258
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,460
- 当然了 - 真理是永恒的 只是没有火鸡

很好 我急需一杯咖啡
Good. I'm jonesing for a cup of coffee.

264
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,330
我是说可以为此在街角卖身的那种急需
I mean sell my sweet white ass on a street corner jonesing.

265
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,320
可不是吗
Yeah, tell me about it.

下午 2:05

副总统先生
Mr. Vice President.

273
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,130
本 我想把你请到桌边坐 但我的妻子
Ben, I would have you to the table, but my wife,

274
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,670
她和我一样特别恨你
she fucking hates you as do I.

275
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,610
我们不得不把火鸡扔垃圾桶里
And we had to throw the turkey in the trash.

为什么总统不做
Oh, why doesn't the president make it?

279
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,590
她因为牙科手术嘴肿了
Her mouth is swollen from dental surgery.

280
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:48,930
- 她做不了声明 - 你特么在逗我
- She can't make a statement. - You're fucking kidding me.

281
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,450
为什么没人通知我
Why wasn't I informed?

282
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,660
你知道专门有体制应对这种可能性的吧
You know there's a system in place for this eventuality?

283
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,180
就在第24和第26条修正案之间[25条要求总统无能力时副总统上任]
It falls between the 24th and 26th Amendment.

284
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,760
她没有注射镇静剂 不是丧失行为能力
She hasn't been sedated. She's not incapacitated.

285
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,540
所以没必要启用第25条
So there was no need to invoke the 25th.

286
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,640
好啊 如果她没有丧失行为能力 你就用不着我
Well, if she's not incapacitated, you don't need me.

287
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,580
她不是没有丧失行为能力
She's not not incapacitated.

288
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,220
她只是不是完全有行为能力
She's just not fully capacitated.

289
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:09,160
你们这帮人
You fucking people.

290
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,620
我说 你把宪法
I mean, you treat the

291
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:12,860
视作DIY披萨菜单
Constitution like a build-your-own-pizza menu.

292
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,630
先生 您冷静而自信
Sir, you're calm, you're confident,

293
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,710
散发出一种刚愎自用的庄严感
you exude a crotchety gravitas.

294
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,780
我们需要了结这件事
We need to shut this down

295
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
就像关掉一所破公立艺术学校一样
like a fucking public school for the arts.

296
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,120
我和总统谈过了
So I've spoken to the president.

297
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,900
她时刻关注着形势
She's up to date with the situation,

298
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,060
我们认为病情已经控制住了
which we think is under control.

299
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,270
- 杰夫? - 您对火鸡末日这个词怎么看
- Yeah, Jeff? - How do you feel about the term Turkeypocalypse?

300
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,900
我认为这是媒体发明的一个术语
I think that's a term invented by the media.

301
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:31,720
愚蠢
It's idiotic,

302
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,860
但能唬住人多看新闻 对吧
but it scares people into watching more news, right?

303
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,410
- 真是神奇 - 是啊 他做得还不错
- This is amazing. - Yeah, he's doing okay.

304
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,650
不 我收到我们面过的那个代孕妈妈的邮件
No, I got an email from that surrogate we met with.

305
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,500
她同意了 我们可以往她体内塞个孩子了
She's on board. We're putting a baby in her.

306
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,810
天啊 麦克 如果你再不专心工作
Jesus, Mike. I'm gonna put a baby in you

307
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,430
- 我就往你体内塞个孩子 - 抱歉
- if you don't get your head in the game. - Sorry.

308
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,420
- 总统在哪里? - 詹姆斯 帮我个忙
- Where is the president? - James, do me a favor.

309
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,440
下次你做牙根管手术 提醒我
Next time you have a root canal, remind me.

310
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,000
道尔轻描淡写沙门氏菌事件

311
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,520
我会过去缠着你 也逼着你一小时内回到办公桌前
I'll come and pester you to be back at your desk in an hour.

312
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,660
天啊 我还以为他会拉一床屎
Christ, I thought he was gonna shit the bed.

313
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,750
相反 他做了夜床服务 还在枕头上留了一片薄荷
Instead he's doing turndown service and leaving a mint on the pillow.

314
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,060
要知道 那可是
You know, that can be

315
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,290
三星和四星酒店之间的差别
the difference between a three- and a four-star hotel.

316
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,690
好吧 谁第一个
All right, who's up first?

317
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,950
我们有国会议员耶格 来自威斯康星州
We've got Congressman Jaeger. He's from Wisconsin.

318
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,740
有招妓问题的那个?
Is he the one with the prostitute problem?

319
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,210
算了 他们都有这个问题
Oh, never mind. They all have that.

320
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,150
众议院就像卡利古拉的卧室[以荒淫闻名的罗马皇帝]
House is like Caligula's room.

321
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,100
- 好吧 你有.. 那个是5 - 好 我知道了

- 当然 我去叫他 - 谢谢

325
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,200
看到没 总统亲自打电话
See? President calling herself.

326
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,410
那可是相当印象深刻
That's gotta be very impressive.

327
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,290
我会开心死
I would die.

328
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,570
总统女士 您好
Yes, Madam President, hello.

329

耶格议员 你好吗
Congressman Jaeger, how are you?

332
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,940
说实话
Well, to be honest,

333
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:37,560
我家的节过得很是艰难
the holidays are a little tough on our family.

334
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,890
我妻子和我有些矛盾
My wife and I are trying to work some things out.

335
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:40,980
妓女
Prostitutes.

336
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,700
我想您一定知道我为什么打电话 议员
So I'm sure that you know why I'm calling, Congressman.

337
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,630
当然 沙氏门菌爆发

338
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,750
女士 您考虑过发表一个声明吗
Ma'am, have you considered making a statement?

我学到危机管理中最重要的一点
If I have learned one thing about crisis management,

340
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,400
就是你需要站出来
it's that you've got to get out there

341
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:53,870
告诉美国人民
and talk to the American people.

342
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,500
如果他们直接从你口中听得消息
If they hear it from you directly,

343
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,410
你就可以逃脱一切责任
you can get away with just about anything.

344
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,090
妓院比尔在给我建议
Bordello Bill is giving me advice.

345
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,990
也许你可以宣布进入紧急状况
Maybe you should declare a state of emergency.

346
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,460
你能做到吗
Are you able to do that?

347
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,720
我可以 但很可惜 我要走了
Yeah, I am, but unfortunately, I have to run.

348

我希望你能在下一轮投票中支持我

我们有国会议员科菲
Okay, we've got Congressman Coffey.

这个是卫生与公共服务部的报告
Here's the statement from Health and Human Services.

358
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,210
他之前也吃不了火鸡啊 除非你把火鸡放搅拌机里
Jeez, he couldn't eat a turkey unless you put it in a blender

359
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:30,540
然后用吸管喂他
and fed it to him through a straw.

360
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:32,380
等等 那些火鸡在宾馆房间里 对吧
Wait, the turkeys have a hotel room, right?

361
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,660
对 我们最好去看看咱的大熊猫
Yes. We better go see the black-eyed pea.

362
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,870
- 喂? - 大新闻 亲爱的

Any news on Sherman?

371
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,400
CNN和Fox新闻台都说他至关重要
CNN and Fox both say he's critical,

372
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,760
Fox是用一个金发大波的主播说的[Fox性别歧视梗]
but Fox says it with blonder hair and bigger tits.

373
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:03,250

是的 议员
Yes, Congressman,

383
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,970
副总统确实是...
the vice president is certainly the...

384
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,470
千年一遇
the president that never was.

385
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:42,940
不好意思?
You know what, actually?

386
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:44,550
我等一下回给你 议员
I'm gonna have to call you back, Congressman.

387
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,040
非常感谢 感恩节快乐 怎么了?
Thank you so much. Happy Thanksgiving. Yes. What?

388
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:48,690
- 谢尔曼去世了
- Sherman's dead.

389
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,420
噢! 天呐 好疼
Ow! Oh, my God, that hurts so much.

390
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,920
- 请不要再这样惊吓我了 - 我们刚刚听说
- Please don't surprise me like that again. - We just got word.

391
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,790
他就不能等到这周末结束吗?
Why couldn't he have waited until after the weekend?

392
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,560
某种程度上
Well, in many ways,

393
00:14:57,610 --> 00:14:59,730
这也可能是个绝好的事
this could be the best thing that could happen.

394
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,940
- 你说什么? - 我们刚刚失去了院里资历最老的一位
- Say what, now? - We just lost the oldest member of the House

395
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,070
我们的总统得顶个纸袋子
and our president can't make

396
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,770
在头上才能露面
a statement without a paper bag on her head.

397
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,000
你没有看到大局 谢尔曼是奥布莱恩的死党
You're missing the big picture. Sherman was an O'Brien diehard.

398
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:12,650
可能奥布莱恩就少了一票 意味着我们可能多了一票
That's one less vote for O'Brien and possibly one vote for us

399
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:14,530
如果顶替他的特殊选举及时 对我们有利的人上台的话
if they can hold a special election in time.

400
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:17,110
新罕布什尔州或许可以成就总统之位
New Hampshire could give us the presidency.

401
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,010
如果早知道 我自己就把他杀了
If I had known that, I would have killed him myself.

402
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,540
乔纳的叔叔杰夫正在飞过来
Jonah's Uncle Jeff is flying down.

403
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,810
他仍然是新罕布什尔州的能够左右候选人选择的权威人物
He's still the kingmaker in New Hampshire.

404
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,580
- 天呐 他是那么 小小的人 对吧? - 对
- God, he is such, like, a little man, isn't he? - He is.

405
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,820
- 日! - 怎么了?
- Fuck! -What?

406
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,140
奥布莱恩正在慰问寡妇
O'Brien is offering condolences to the widow.

407
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,340
我们必须找人就谢尔曼的事说点什么了
We got to get somebody to say something about Sherman.

408
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:34,470
绝对不能是道尔 谁都行就是不能是副总统
Not Doyle. Anyone but the veep.

409
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,760
- 我们要弄死道尔 - 我不能保证
- We got to lance that Doyle. - No promises, ma'am.

410
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,440
- 什么? - 不保证
- What? - No promises.

411
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,170
拜托
Come on.

412
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,100
- 这是什么? - 你的感恩节大餐
- What is that? - It's your Thanksgiving meal.

413
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,150
为什么准备了两位?
Why are there two place settings?

414
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,420
你知道查理不会来的吧?
You know Charlie's not coming, right?

415
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,460
我知道 这只是为了
I do. That was just for

416
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,910
以防你想有人陪同
in case you wanted someone to sit with you.

417
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:52,270
不为了吃饭 只为了谈心
Not to eat, just to talk.

418
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,400
或者安安静静的
Or be quiet.

419
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,670
- 我不饿 - 我也是
- I'm not hungry. - Me neither.

420
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,060
- 你又来? - 谢尔曼去世了
- You again? - Sherman's dead.

421
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,850
我们需要你做另一个声明
We need you to make another statement.

422
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,690
本 牙科手术到底是什么的代号?
What is dental surgery code for anyway, Ben?

423
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,710
难道是漂白菊花之类的?
I mean, is it like anal bleaching?

424
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:08,120
因为如果是的话 你就直接说出来好了
Because if it is, you should just come out and say that

425
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,500
因为美国人民 他们慢慢就会接受了
because the American people, they'll accept it in time.

426
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,560
老实讲 先生 她看起来并不好
To be honest with you, sir, she's not looking real good.

427
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,010
我也老实讲
And I'll be honest with you.

428
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,190
我并不觉得你有对我老实
I don't think you're being honest about being honest.

429
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,820
所以你知道吗? 我要见总统
So you know what? I want to see the president.

430
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:22,440
- 这就没必要了吧 - 别传话了
- That won't be necessary. - No more messengers, Ben.

431
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,020
如果她想我做她的屁事
If she wants me to do her bullshit,

432
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,240
她可以带着她闪亮亮的菊花来亲自说服我
she can tell me out of her own shining white asshole.

433
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,950
今天的媒体拜访可是个壮举
Today's media-go-round was a tour De force.

434
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,920
更像是对事件的壮费
More like a waste De time.

435
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,810
可能你觉得我忙于
Well, maybe you thought I was too busy

436
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:38,150
整理你的垃圾邮件而没有意识到
sorting through your junk mail folder to realize

437
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,750
你提到的关于绿皮西葫芦和大西洋城 还有辉瑞[美国制药公司]
you mentioned things like zucchini and Atlantic City and Pfizer,

438
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:43,870
所有的客户 当然
all clients, of course,

439
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,210
还有"为什么老是打电话给我”的西德尼·珀塞尔
of Sidney "Why is That Guy Calling Me" Purcell.

440
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,220
我还说了其他的单词
I used a lot of other words, too.

441
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,500
我很确定我说了"小" 和 "心"
I'm pretty sure I said "Be" And also "Careful."

442
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:58,830
我不知道你的终极大招是什么 但我想加入
I don't know what your endgame is, but I want in.

443
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,100
我会把人类的耳朵当做战利品带回来给你做项链
I will bring you back human ears for a necklace.

444
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,190
我是你的
I am your guy.

445
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,190
你是不是有过一次 精神崩溃?
Didn't you have, like, a nervous breakdown?

446
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,660
- 你有过一次精神崩溃 对吧? - 那不是精神崩溃
- You had a nervous breakdown, right? - It was not a breakdown.

447
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:12,950
更像是一次心理上的消化不良
It was just more a little bit of psychological indigestion.

448
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,180
你刚从内华达回来 而且你输了重新投票
You just got back from Nevada and you lost the recount.

449
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,780
压力一定很大吧
It's got to be a pretty stressful time.

450
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,820
给我感觉你在混吃等死
Seems to me like you're spinning out.

451
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,620
至少我会这么告诉大家
At least that's what I'm gonna have to tell everyone.

452
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:22,700
真是耻辱啊
Which would be a shame.

453
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,150
你说得对 我都不知道我们在说些什么
You're right. I don't even know what we were talking about.

454
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:29,420
我们在说你的精神状况  丹
We're talking about your mental state, Dan.

455
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,080
你的嘴唇看起来很干
Your lips are looking a little dry.

456
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,890
- 我看看我有没有带润唇膏 - 乖乖啊
- I just want to see if I have that balm. - Oh, goodie.

457
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,140
本正在把副总统道尔带过来
Ben is bringing over Vice President Doyle.

458
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,290
他坚持要见你
He insisted on seeing you.

459
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:44,940
原谅我 但你一定要对他客气点
Forgive me, but you have to be nice to him.

460
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,540
什么? 我知道啊
What? I know that.

461
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,220
为什么每个人都在说我要客气点?
Why is everybody always telling me to be nice?

462
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,000
好吧? 这是... 里
All right? It is... oh, here.

463
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,640
- 上帝的二舅老爷啊 - 安德鲁
- Jesus Horatio Christ. - Andrew.

464
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,160
无需多言 我不是做了牙根管手术
Needless to say, I did not have root canal.

465
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:04,200
谢了 大家 我可以了 请坐
Thanks, guys. I got it. Come, sit down, please.

466
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,430
你都不知道我有多感谢你
Can I just say how much I appreciate

467
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,970
在感恩节抽空来见我?
your coming down on your Thanksgiving

468
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:11,600
谢谢你
and giving it up to come here? Thank you.

469
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,720
谢尔曼可能不是一派人
Sherman may have been from the other side of the aisle,

470
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,810
但他是一个好人
but he's a decent guy

471
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,710
尽管他还用有色人种这种词
even though he still used the word coloreds.

472
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,620
人无完人嘛
Oh, well, nobody's perfect, right?

473
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,540
你可以省了废话了 塞琳娜
You can cut the shit, Selina.

474
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:23,580
我已经有两个月基本没见到你了
I have barely seen you for two months.

475
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,150
- 很抱歉 - 好
- Well, apologies about that. - Okay.

476
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,700
听着 我会出去带着标准的迷人微笑
Listen, I will go out there with my golden boy smile,

477
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,690
- 让他们感受到道尔的绚烂之光 -好的
- give 'em the Doyle dazzle. - Okay.

478
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,280
但我想要一些回报
But there's something I want in return.

479
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,620
我想你考虑我作为国务卿
I want to be considered for Secretary of State.

480
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,260
那个位子是我一直想要的
It's the job I've always wanted.

481
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,690
休斯说过如果他第二期赢了就会把那个位子给我
Hughes said that he would give it to me if he won a second term.

482
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,700
他还说了他会把你赶下台
And he also said he'd kick you off the ticket.

483
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,660
道尔的绚烂之光出来了 真迷人啊
See, there's that Doyle dazzle and I'm a big fan of it.

484
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,700
安德鲁 我是个守信的人
Andrew, I'm a woman of my word

485
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,180
我向你保证
and you have my word.

486
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,430
好吧
Fair enough.

487
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,030
- 好的 很好 - 你是被本打的吗?
- Okay, good. All right. - Say, did Ben do this to you?

488
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,590
我可以送你去个家暴庇护所
Because I can get you to a shelter.

489
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:10,290
- 太逗啦 - 说真的 我知道他说过爱你
- That's so funny. - Seriously, I know he says he loves you,

490
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,630
但你要是不提起诉讼的话 总有一天他会杀了你的
but if you don't press charges, he's gonna kill you someday.

491
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:16,140
这个我喜欢 和家暴有关的笑话 正好戳我笑点
I love it. Domestic abuse jokes. They just tickle me.

492
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,620
你们大部分人都已经知道了
As most of you already know,

493
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,100
议员哈利·谢尔曼
Congressman Harry Sherman passed away today

494

今天在他所热爱的新罕布什尔州
in a hospital near his home

496
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,610
于家附近的医院里辞世
in his beloved state of New Hampshire.

497
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,130
我要告诉你们一个消息 一个重大消息
Hey, I've got something for you guys, something big.

498
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,360
我觉得汤姆和西德尼·珀塞尔之间有问题
I think Tom is up to something with Sidney Purcell.

499
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,560
什么?
Up to what?

500
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,060
他今天在每个节目里
At each of today's programs,

501
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,820
都提到了一位珀塞尔的客户
he mentioned one of Purcell's clients.

502
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:39,810
比如西葫芦 辉瑞公司 养殖三文鱼
I mean, zucchini, Pfizer, farmed salmon.

503
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:42,260
- 他可没那么蠢 - 很明显就能看出来
- Tom is not that stupid. - There's a clear pattern.

504
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:45,040
我注意到了 所以我拿证据和他对峙
And I noticed it, so I confronted him with the evidence.

505
00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:47,390
- 然后呢? - 他说我疯了
- And? - And he said that I was crazy.

506
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,530
- 你知道真相可能是什么吗? - 什么?
- You know what it could be? - What?

507
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,850
你他妈真的疯了
That you are fucking crazy.

508
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,860

你知道是恐慌发作的症状
You know it was a fucking panic attack.

00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,520
并没有 只闻到浪漫的气息
No, nothing. Just the whiff of romance.

Why don't you tell me about Vegas? Did you two girls have fun?

531
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,990
有一个找到了
Well, one of us did,

532
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:42,940
但是在拉斯维加斯发生的事就留在拉斯维加斯吧
but what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.

533
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,180
上帝啊 我再说最后一遍 那不是在拉斯维加斯发生的

别逼我打电话给你们爸爸
Do not make me call your fathers.

537
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,020
搞什么鬼? 你怎么不接电话?
What the fuck? You're not answering your phone?

538
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,710
- 我家人把电话藏起来了- 听着 我得征求下你的意见
- My family hid it. - Look, I've got to run something by you.

539
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,410
我举双手赞成你像个丑陋的妇女一样生活
I fully support your decision to live as an ugly woman.

00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,680
新罕布什尔州要为谢尔曼的席位进行选举
for the seat before Christmas.

548
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,650
- 但是... - 听着真他妈像个巨大的转折
- But... - Sounds like a big goddamn but.

549
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,430
是啊 这是个和丰满且强健的小威廉姆斯屁股一样巨大的转折
Oh, yeah, this is a giant, juicy, muscular Serena Williams but.

谢尔曼的遗孀将宣布
Sherman's widow is about to announce

551
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,480
她要竞选那个席位

552
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,530
我不断的做着
I have recurring nightmares

553
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,270
和寡妇们竞选的噩梦
about running against widows.

554
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,760
这儿有经审查的名单
We've got a list of vetted names here.

555
00:21:26,810 --> 00:21:28,510
为什么不把它直接给我呢?
Great, why don't you send them right over to me?

556
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,490
- 我正好要没厕纸用了 - 你说什么?
- I'm running low on toilet paper. - Excuse me?

557
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:34,030
大胡子 你没资格给我名单 是我给你名单
You don't give me names, Beardo. I give you names.

558
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,180
所以拿着你的名单
So take your list, roll it up real tiny,

559
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,050
把它卷成一团绑在信鸽的腿上
attach it to the leg of a carrier pigeon,

560
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:39,740
让它飞得远远的
and have it fly up tubby's dick.

561
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,120
那么你选谁?
So who's your choice?

562
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,180
我推荐我侄子以斯拉
You know I'm grooming my nephew Ezra.

563
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,950
久闻其名
Heard a lot of great things about Ezra.

564
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:47,690
杰出 帅气 妻子肯定有八分
Brilliant, handsome, wife's a solid eight.

565
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:49,460
有了孩子以后 估计也有七分

Mark my words, he will be president someday.

567
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,350
但以斯拉目前正在阿富汗服役呢
But Ezra's currently serving in Afghanistan.

568
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:57,420
此外 有任何人想战胜那个寡妇的话
Besides, for anyone to beat the widow,

569
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,630
都得做点见不得人的事
they're gonna have to fight dirty

570
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:00,600
- 我可不在吃饭的地方上大号 - 我也不
- and I don't shit where I eat. - Well, me neither,

571
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,140
自从我妻子逮到我在厕所喝酸奶之后
not since my wife caught me eating yogurt on the crapper.

572
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,340
我们需要个炮灰
We need a real piece of cannon fodder here,

573
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,640
一个愿意牺牲自己的名誉
some spectacular dumbass

574
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,840
冲锋陷阵
willing to charge this machine gun nest,

575
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,880
然后滚到一边去
sacrifice his name and reputation,

576
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,310
让以斯拉可以顺利当选的十足的傻逼
and then fuck off so Ezra can slide right in.

577
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,780
你有傻逼的名单吗?
So do you have a list of spectacular dumbasses?

578
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,370
名单上只有一个名字
There's only one name on it.

579
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,900
在康涅狄格 我和家人
For my family back in Connecticut, we ditched the turkey.

580
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,920
把火鸡切开
That's because I have a special recipe

581
00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:27,090
因为我有制作西葫芦拌三文鱼的独家食谱
for farmed salmon with a side of zucchini.

582
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,150
- 看到没 它们都是客户 - 这意味着什么?
- See? They're both clients. - Well, what does it mean?

583
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,260
- 我不知道 - 他也不知道 他怎么可能知道?
- I don't know. - He doesn't know. Why would he know?

584
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,000
甜点有苹果派和核桃派 你想吃什么?
So for dessert, there's apple and pecan pie. What would you like?

585
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,310
两个我都想尝一点
You know, I would love a little bit of both.

586
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,380
两个你都要 是吗?
Oh, you want both, do you?

587
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,940
- 有何不可吗? - 我来告诉你有何不可 你这个吃屎的好色之徒
- Yeah, why not? - I'll tell you why not, you shit sack Casanova.

588
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,220
你上了我的两个女儿
You have had sex with both of my daughters.

589
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,590
你毫无羞耻之心吗? 等一下
I mean, have you no shame? Wait a minute,

590
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,570
亲爱的 我才发现
sweetie, I just figured it out.

591
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,210
你知道吗? 你是不是还想上我老婆?
You know what it is? You want to fuck my wife, too, don't you?

592
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,440
- 晚安 布鲁克海默的一家人 - 再见 丹
- Good night, Brookheimers. - Bye, Dan.

593
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,030
抱歉
Sorry.

594
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,030
乔纳母亲家中

595
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:59,030
新罕布什尔州

596
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,540
瑞安夫人 这些感恩节的旧照都是无价之宝
Mrs. Ryan, these old Thanksgiving photos are priceless.

597
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,560
瞧这龅牙
Wow, that is some overbite.

598
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,790
看着跟兔子一样
It's like a wererabbit.

599
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,330
我发育比较早
Well, I was advanced for my age.

600
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,250
四岁恒牙就都长好了
I had all my adult teeth by age four.

601
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,440
我都不晓得那个年纪孩子们还在系皮带
I didn't know children still wore leashes at this age.

602
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:11,400
- 祝大家感恩节快乐 - 杰夫
- Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. - Okay, Jeff.

603
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,250
我得和你说
I should tell you that

604
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:13,640
白肉不够分了
there's not enough white meat to go around.

605
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,580
- 我可不想再现79年的惨剧 - 无所谓啦
- I don't want a repeat of 79. - Whatever.

606
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:18,330
我来这儿是因为 由于谢尔曼去世
Listen, the reason I'm here... now that Sherman is dead,

607
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:18,980
将会进行特殊选举
there is going to be a special election

608
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:22,360
来补选席位代表的...
special election back home for the seat and...

609
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:26,390
你想让我游说战争英雄以斯拉表哥吗?
Oh, you want me to canvass for Cousin Ezra the war hero?

610
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,620
不 我想让你竞选
No, I want you to run.

611
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,010
你想让我来管理他的竞选吗?
You want me to run his campaign?

612
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,820
不 乔纳 我想让你竞选这个席位
No, Jonah, I want you to run for the seat.

613
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,030
小乔纳?
Joni?

614
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,240
指引我并抚养我的上帝呀
Dear Lord who guides me and nourishes me,

615
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,070
我怀着决心与铁腕走上了这条
I set foot on this path that you have laid before me

616
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,570
您指引的道路
with a strong arm and a willing heart

617
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:59,240
就是为了震撼政坛 阿门
to totally rock this shit. Amen.

618
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,630
乔纳·瑞安记 第五章
The Jonah Ryan story, chapter five.

619
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,270
众议院臣服于他膝下
The House kneels before the fucking J-man.

620
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,560
我要参与国会竞选了!
I'm running for Congress!

621
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,890
天呐 不错呀
Oh, my God, that's great.

622
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:11,130
真正的国会还是一些想象中的国会?
Actual Congress or some fantasy league Congress?

623
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,490
当然 要想对抗谢尔曼的寡妇
Of course, up against the Widow Sherman,

624
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:14,110
简直像把你的蛋蛋钉在钢琴上
it's gonna be like climbing Mt. McKinley

625
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,750
然后爬上麦金利山一样困难
with your balls stapled to a piano.

626
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,850
我投她票了 上帝保佑
She's got my vote, bless her heart.

627
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:19,980
任何挑战都不能阻挡无所不能的乔纳·瑞安
Ain't a challenge been invented Jonah Ryan can't do.

628
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,470
冰桶挑战 这个你就不行
Ice bucket challenge. You backed out of that.

629
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,420
让冰桶挑战玩蛋去吧
Ice bucket challenge can suck my dick.

630
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,670
它确实引起了公众对肌萎缩性侧索硬化症的关注
Well, it did raise a lot of awareness for whatever ALS is.

631
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,910
- 这货是谁? - 理查德·史培雷
- Who is this man? - Richard Splett.

632
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,660
- 史培雷? - 史培雷
- Splett? - Splett.

633
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,620
乔纳 只有一个条件
Yeah, okay. This is just for one term here, Jonah.

634
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:35,850
你只能算是以斯拉的一个占位的
You're merely acting as a placeholder for Ezra.

635
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,450
只要我进去了就不会出来的
Once I'm in, I'm in.

636
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,060
我在白宫实习过三周时间
I went to the White House on a three-week placement.

637
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:42,990
我就是个感染源 没人能甩得了乔纳·瑞安
I'm a MRSA infection. You don't get rid of Jonah Ryan.

638
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,430
听我说 我不是问你 我是在告诉你
Listen to me, all right? I'm not asking you, I am telling you.

639
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,670
对 但是如果以斯拉表哥
Yeah, but it's not my fault

640
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:50,060
最后要给我舔精 变成天使嗓音的亚特·加芬克尔
if Cousin Lezra ends up eating my nut dust

641
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:50,940
身旁的傻小弟保罗·西蒙[民谣音乐二人团西蒙和加芬克尔]
and becoming the goofy

642
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,550
那也不怪我呀
Paul Simon to my angelic-voiced Art Garfunkel.

643
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,340
- 你能弯下腰听我说几句吗? - 好啊
- Can I talk to you down here just a minute? - Yeah.

644
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,850
听我说 你就是个行走的21三体症
Now listen to me, you walking trisomy.

645
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,030
在新罕布什尔州 我能让避孕套里的狗屎当选议员
I could get dog shit in a condom elected in New Hampshire.

646
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,630
你就是我的傀儡 是我让你这么风光的
You are my puppet. I'd let you dance.

647
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,890
就算到了我决定废掉你 选择扶持以斯拉的那天
And when I stuff you back in the toy box to let Ezra lead,

648
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,200
你也会对我感激涕零
you will be grateful I ever

649
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,470
感谢我曾经让你的榆木脑袋上台过
let your wooden painted face take the stage.

650
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,150
现在 你到底听明白了吗?
Now, do you or do you not understand me?!

651
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:16,680
- 是的 先生 对不起 - 这才对
- Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir. - Yeah.

652
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,170
- 杰夫 - 别来烦我
- Jeff. Jeff. - Hey, leave it.

653
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,930
我不想让你对小乔纳大喊大叫
I don't want you screaming at Joni.

654
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,890
祝贺您 先生 我能否有幸成为您的第一个竞选成员呢?
Congratulations, sir. May I be the first to join your campaign?

655
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,740
- 当然 你是总参谋长 - 不 我要用实力获得这个职位
- Absolutely, chief of staff. - Please let me earn it.

656
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,270
还有有个审查过程的
There will be a vetting process.

657
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,810
白宫媒体说明会

658
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:29,820
下午 8:03

659
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,580
那我现在先回答几个问题
Okay, I'll just take a few questions first,

660
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,680
然后我再把你带上来 好么?
then I'll bring you up again, okay?

661
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,480
- 好 - 那就这样
- All right. - Okay.

662
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,830
等等 如果你在一张火鸡的床上做爱的话
Oh, hey, is it possible to get salmonella

663
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:41,030
会有可能感染沙门菌吗?
if you were to make love in a turkey's bed?

664
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:44,170
- 你说什么? - 火鸡当时不在床上
- I'm sorry? - I should add the turkeys were no longer there.

665
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,300
算了 我马上回来
Never mind. I'll be back.

666
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,910
- 迈克! - 您要见我 女士?
- Mike! Mike! Mike! - You wanted to see me, ma'am?

667
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:52,120
跟新罕布什尔州的拿破仑谈的怎么样了?
How'd it go with the New Hampshire Napoleon?

668
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:55,110
- 他有很多奇思妙想 - 是吗?
- He's got a lot of ideas. - Yeah? Good.

669
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,350
天呐 你来看看这个
Oh, my God. Would you look at this?

670
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:58,920
迈克 为什么她不出来讲话?
Mike, why won't she give a statement?

671
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:01,560
世上有和我年龄相仿的女人此时正在被舔阴
Somewhere in the world there's a woman exactly my age

672
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,090
而我却要留在这里看这种东西
getting her pussy eaten and I'm stuck here watching this.

673
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:05,960
不行 我一定要出去
God, I've got to get out there.

674
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:08,060
沙门氏菌危机加剧

675
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,350
中国南海

676
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:12,350
27小时后

677
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,270
当海军上将博格尔第一次向我说起这次行程的时候
When Admiral Burger first suggested this trip,

678
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:15,820
我想 放弃与我心爱的女儿凯瑟琳
it seemed like a very small sacrifice

679
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:18,170
共度传统的感恩节
to forgo a traditional Thanksgiving

680
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,200
只是一次小小的牺牲
with my beloved daughter Catherine

681
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,390
而更重要的事是要到这里
and travel here to be with

682
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:25,470
与我们勇敢的水手和海军们共度佳节
our brave sailors and Marines.

并对这次行程保密
as to the secrecy of this trip

686
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,980
这就是我最近几天为什么不与公众往来的原因
and why I've had to be incommunicado for the last few days.

687
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,050

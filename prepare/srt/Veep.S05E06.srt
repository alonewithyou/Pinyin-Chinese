因为看起来你关心你男朋友
Cause that's gonna look like you care more about your boyfriend

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,460
胜过关心经济 人民
than you do the economy, normal people,

或者其他总统应该关心的东西
and everything else you're supposed to care about.

再次见到你很高兴
It's good seeing you again.

147
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,070
怎么了? 我有麻烦了吗?
What's this about? Am I in trouble?

148
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,060
不是 总统
No, no. The president

149
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:04,400
让我就一个特别的问题跟每个人谈谈
asked me to speak to everyone about a certain matter.

150
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,280
是关于我从厨房拿走的咖啡包吗?
Is this about the coffee pods I took from the kitchen?

151
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,540
- 我们吃了个早午餐然后我就拿了 - 不是
- We had a brunch and I took them. - No. No.

152
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,440
迈克 你知道是谁叫总统婊子了吗?
Mike, do you know who called the president a cunt?

153
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,710
不知道 我... 完全不知道
No, I-- I have no idea.

154
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,750
好吧 对不起 我做不来
Okay, I'm sorry. I can't do this.

155
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,530
她让我来领导这个傻逼的调查
She put me in charge of this whole stupid investigation

156
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,880
但是就是我做的 我骂她婊子的
and it was me. I called her a cunt.

157
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,240
是你?
You did?

158
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,470
我以为大家都知道是我
I thought everyone knew it was me.

159
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,890
我当时和丹在参议院的大楼里
I was in the Senate building with Dan

160
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,960
我确定有人听到了我
and I'm sure someone overheard me.

161
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,790
我在火车上的私密车厢里打电话时说的
I shouted it into my phone on the Acela Quiet Car.

162
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,980
周五 下午 3:09

163
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,980
距股票开市还有66小时

164
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:36,950
好吧
Okay.

165
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,360
我已经做出了决定
I've made my decision.

166
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:41,310
我们要援助查理的银行
We are going to bail out Charlie's bank.

167
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,690
我不在乎失多少选票
I don't care what hits we take.

168
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,440
从长远看这是为了国家好
It's for the good of the country in the long run.

169
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,070
- 干得漂亮 总统女士 - 对
- Bravo, Madam President. - Yeah.

170
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,510
- 女士 我能不能就... - 不能
- Ma'am, if I could just-- - Nope.

171
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,140
我不想听 好吗?
I don't want to hear it, okay?

172
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,090
这就是我的最终决定
That's my final solution.

173
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,100
我用了 《谁想成为百万富翁》里的梗
"Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,560
明白了吗? 对
Do you get it? Yeah.

175
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,290
瑞安竞选总办公室

176
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,290
纳舒厄 新罕布什尔州

177
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,370
我绝对不能忘记
I can't ever forget

178
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,000
一切为了人民
it's about the people.

179
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,700
你有在拍吗?
Are you even getting any of this?

180
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,720
拍什么?
Getting what?

181
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,160
我正在全神贯注的凝视窗外啊
I was looking thoughtfully out the window.

182
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:12,080
明显的肯尼迪式深思啊
Some straight up JFK level shit.

183
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,740
我在给传真机拍一些幕后花絮
I was just getting some B-roll of the fax machine.

184
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,420
拜托!
Ah! Come on!

185
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,280
天呐
God.

186
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,920
你知道吗 你住的这个州烂死了
You know, the state that you live in sucks.

187
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:26,550
先生 作为你的交流总指挥
Sir, as your director of communications,

188
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,070
我需要告诉你我们刚刚收到了一封来自匆促乐团的信
I need to tell you that we just got a letter from the band Rush.

189
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:29,940
- 真的? - 他们说
- Really? - They said that

190
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,700
我们不能再用那首《工人》了
we can't use the song "Working Man" Anymore

191
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:34,100
因为他们讨厌你
because they find you odious.

192
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,620
我想放什么歌就放什么歌
You know what? I play what I want.

193
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,540
Zune出现之后版权就都是屎了
Copyright shit went out with the Zune.

194
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,070
哎呦 不好意思 你来这儿干嘛?
Whoa, I'm sorry. What are you doing here?

195
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,860
哟 乔纳 理查德
Hello, Jonah. Richard.

196
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,950
- 嗨 凯瑟琳 - 你跟我说话片子就毁了
- Hi, Catherine. - When you talk to me, you ruin the film.

197
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,000
看见你总是很舒畅啊
Always a pleasure.

198
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,180
我是你的新任竞选经理
I'm here to be your new campaign manager.

199
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:52,870
我天 你是过来求我找活儿干的吗?
Holy shit, are you here to beg me for a job?

200
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:55,870
作为通讯主任 我本该对这种事有所提防的
As director of communication, I should have been alerted to this.

201
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,630
哎呦 干嘛不坐下啊
Uh, why don't you have a seat

202
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,340
先说说你的工作经历 然后我们再详谈?
and tell me about your job history and we'll go from there?

203
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,390
乔纳 从现在开始
From now on, Jonah, you

204
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,710
他妈的闭上你那烂嘴 按我说的去做
will shut the fuck up and do exactly as I say.

205
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:05,020
要是你听了我的  而不是就靠你自个儿那
And if you listen to me instead of your only two brain cells

206
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,210
空荡荡的畸形脑袋瓜里
busy butt-fucking each other

207
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:08,830
天天忙着互相操对方菊花的俩脑细胞的话
somewhere in the vast expanses of your misshapen skull,

208
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,320
没准 乔纳 你没准还可能
then maybe, Jonah, you might have a chance

209
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:14,130
成为第一个赢得美国议员竞选的
at becoming the first mentally impaired Frankenstein's monster

210
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,650
脑残智障弗兰肯斯坦怪物
to ever win an American election.

211
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,090
捎带说一句 那些标语上
And by the way, your banner

212
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,840
你的名字看起来像 乔·H·赖安
makes it look like your name is Jon H. Ryan,

213
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,900
干得不错嘛 通讯部门
so great job, communications department.

214
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,020
- 这办公室是我的了 - 那是我的办公室
- I'm taking this office. - Wait, that's my office.

215
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,450
这我都录下了
I got that.

216
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,140
周五 下午 7:45

217
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,140
距股票开市还有62小时

218
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,720
这么大压力 你是怎么保持气色的
How do you look so good with all this stress?

219
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,720
整个人简直熠熠生辉
You're glowing.

220
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,120
实际上还看起来更年轻了 怎么保养的?
You actually look younger. What did you do?

221
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:34,010
天哪 他发现了
Oh, my God, he noticed.

222
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:34,960
- 啥? - 你知道的
- What? - Mmm.

223
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,710
我用了新的脸霜
Uh, I have a new facial moisturizer.

224
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,890
- 这样啊 - 还有新的香皂
- Oh. - And a new soap.

225
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,910
- 盖瑞 - 好 我就站这边儿
- Gary. - Yeah, I'll just stand over here.

226
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,700
- 实际上 我是想... - 那我还是出去吧
- Actually, I think - I'll just leave the room.

227
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,300
- 对快出去 - 好好好
- Yes. - Yeah.

228
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
赛琳娜 我想跟你说声抱歉
Listen, Selina, I want to apologize.

229
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,400
我知道我们的关系跟你的工作有冲突
I know that our relationship has compromised your job.

230
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,040
- 没错 - 但是你是总统
- Yeah. - But you're the president.

231
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,160
你的决定都是最好的
Whatever you decide is best.

232
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,150
你怎么决定也不会影响我们的关系
And it won't affect our relationship one way or another.

233
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,840
- 嗯 - 好了 不谈工作了
- Okay. - Now, enough shoptalk.

234
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,110
- 太好了 - 嗯

235
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,000
- 我们来聊点别的 - 行啊

236
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,560

237
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,080
- 成 - 那我们快点

238
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,560
九点半我就得撤了
I got wheels up at 9:30.

239
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,320
说的我都有点性奋
Ooh, that turns me on.

240
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,680
周六 上午 2:01

241
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,680
距股票开市还有55小时

242
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,900
- 您好 女士 - 艾米 到我办公室来一趟
- Hello, ma'am. -  Amy, come to my office.

243
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,920
- 现在? - 没错
- Right now? - Yeah.

244
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,110
好的
Of course.

245
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,240
提醒我
Set a reminder.

246
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:33,120
去预约冷冻卵子
Make an appointment to freeze eggs.

247
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,420
女士 你怎么样?
Ma'am, are you okay?

248
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,040
- 艾米 让你做的调查进行的怎么样了? - 挺顺利
- Amy, how's the investigation going? - Oh, uh, fine.

249
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,250
那个有人骂我婊子的调查
I mean, the investigation of me being called a cunt.

250
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:45,310
- 我知道您指的是哪个调查 - 那就行
- I knew which one you meant. - Yeah, good.

251
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,220
不过 我想
Well, it does occur to me

252
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,750
我们现在还有很多事要忙
that we've all got a lot on our plates right now.

253
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,750
- 嗯 - 所以 我觉得应该先把这调查放一放
- Yeah. - So I think we should push this investigation

254
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,990
等先把别的事搞完...
until after everything...

255
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:55,690
你去把那个杰瑞·杜肯
I want you to fire Gerry Duggan,

256
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,760
菲尔·内亚德 还有那个叫丽萨什么鬼的... 都给我开了
Phil Neary and what's her ass, Lisa...

257
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,030
- 哈奇? - 对就是她 把她踢出通讯部 听见了吗?
- Hatch? - Yeah, I want her out of the comms department, okay?

258
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,230
因为他们一开始就不应该让
Because they should not have let an article

259
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:07,170
有人骂我婊子这事被报到出去
about me being called a cunt get out in the first place, right?

260
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,200
- 那个 我没有资格... - 开了他们
- Well, I'm not the person who... - Fire them.

261
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:12,210
- 明白了 - 我是美国的第一任女性总统
- Okay. - I am the first female president

262
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,620
这次的事是种公开侮辱
of the United States and this is an affront.

263
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,840
是的女士
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:20,710
我告诉你 艾米
I'll tell you something, Amy.

265
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,390
有很多人都反对我当总统
A lot of people don't want me to be president.

266
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,790
原因你也知道  毕竟从根本上来讲
And you know why. Because fundamentally,

267
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,630
大家都不喜欢女人 不是么
people hate women, right?

268
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:31,460
我是说 为了把我赶下台 他们根本不会罢休的
I mean, they'll just stop at nothing to get me out of here.

269
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,190
谁都想抓我的把柄 但我绝对不会让他们得逞的
Everybody's trying to get me, but I'm not gonna let them.

270
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:36,410
你还好吗 女士?
You okay, ma'am?

271
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,210
你被骂过婊子吗?
Have you ever been called a cunt?

272
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,700
好多次
Many times.

273
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,650
现在我也算经历过了 一次
Well, now I have, too, apparently once.

274
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,190
周六 上午 9:08

275
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,190
距股票开市还有48小时

276
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,760
妈妈 我回来了
Hey, Mom, I'm back.

277
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,160
你原来不在这吗? 对 你去新罕布什尔了
You were gone? Oh, right, you were in New Hampshire.

278
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,030
- 盖瑞 现在方便吗? - 嗯啊
- Gary, is now a good time? - Mm-hmm.

279
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,030
- 什么? 我的时间又不归他管 - 嗯 是
- What? He's not in charge of me. - Mm-mmm.

280
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,800
- 我就是想问 你现在方便跟我说几句话吗? - 说吧
- I just wanted to know can we talk for a second? - Yeah.

281
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,860
我觉得 自从外婆去世后
I feel like since Mee-Maw died,

282
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,730
我有空来反省一些事了
I've had some time to reflect on things

283
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,160
你知道 就是为什么我跟杰森谈不来啊
and, you know, why things didn't work out between me and Jason.

284
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,100
- 这个  - 还有我跟学校里那个喜欢看我尿尿的人也分了
- Uh-huh. - Or the guy in college who wanted to watch me pee.

285
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,980
我跟那个声音高得奇怪的人也没有结果
Or the guy with the weirdly high voice.

286
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,070
不 是有两个人声音都挺尖的
No, there were two guys with weirdly high voices.

287
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,940
- 对 是两个 - 你记得吗?
- Yeah, there were two. - Do you remember?

288
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,120
- 我尝试着...  - 总统女士
- I've been trying... -  Madam President.

289
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:21,770
怎么了? 凯瑟琳 我现在有事要处理
Yeah? I have to deal with whatever this is, okay, Catherine?

290
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,470
待会儿再聊
So we can talk later.

291
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,380
- 我什么都不想听 - 女士
- Guys, I don't want to hear it. - Ma'am.

292
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,590
- 女士 - 不 先生们 你知道我不会重新考虑这事儿了
- Ma'am. - No, guys, you know I'm not gonna rethink it.

293
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,220
- 我已经做了决定 - 总统女士!
- I've made the decision. - Madam President!

294
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,440
如果你还想保住这头衔的话!
That is if you'd like for that to remain your title!

295
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,440
天哪 怎么啦?
Wow. What?

296
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,830
事情比我们想的还糟
It's worse than we thought.

297
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,230
我算了下 援助你性伴侣的银行
I ran the numbers. Approval rating for bailing out

298
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:45,080
这件事的支持率只有... 4.3%
your sexual partner's financial establishment... 4.3%.

299
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,560
光明节在麦加的民调都比这个高[光明节为犹太节日 麦加为伊斯兰圣地]
Hanukah polls higher in Mecca.

300
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,770
但经济上讲确实该援助这个银行对吧?
But it's the right bank to bail out, right?

301
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,230
是的 女士 可没有人懂经济
That's right, ma'am, but nobody understands the economy.

302
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:54,630
- 完全真没人懂 - 也不能说完全
- Literally nobody. - Not literally.

303
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,850
我们就这样会在
And then I think we lose

304
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,720
国会输掉三、四个州的
three or four states in Congress just like that.

305
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,880
如果硬要你们在屌和蛋之间选一个
What would you guys do if you

306
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,950
你们会怎么做?
had to choose between your cock and your balls?

307
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,220
我可以都不要 现阶段
I could lose them both. I mean,

308
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,350
对我来说它们都只是装饰物
at this stage they're purely decorative.

309
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,960
同志们 有谁等会儿想去吃韩国汉城烤肉的吗?
Guys, you want to go out later for some Hansong Korean Barbecue?

310
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,710
韩国烤肉就是山寨一点都不正宗
Korean barbecue is a travesty and a far cry from authentic.

311
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,120
- 加一 - 苏?
- I'm his plus one. - Sue?

312
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,640
刚说的是韩语的"我恨你"
That's Korean for "I hate you."

313
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,330
马乔里?
Marjorie?

314
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,560
这是她名字吧?
That is her name, right?

315
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,130
周六 上午 9:42

316
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,130

317
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,620
各位 很抱歉这么做
Sorry to do this, everyone.

318
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,630
但我已经慎重思考过了
But I've done some deep soul diving

319
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,590
我们要援助鲍尔斯丁-博尔翰
and we are going to bail out Paulsten Berheim.

320
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,090
- 擦 - 想办法吧
- Oh, fuck. - Make that happen.

321
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,750
谢谢他妈不存在的上帝
Thank nonexistent Jesus.

雪莉

325
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,800
不行 我不想戴眼镜
No, I don't know. I don't want to wear the glasses.

326
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,310
这是你新形象的一部分
They're part of your relaunch.

327
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,080
让你看起来聪明多了 你个傻逼
They make you look half smart, you fucking goon.

328
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,400
你知道我们那个年代怎么称呼你这种人吗?
You know what we call people like you back in my day?

329
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,640
智障
Retards.

330
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,930
汤姆·裴迪[歌手]说不能再放他的《永不退缩》了
Tom Petty says we can't use "Won't Back Down" Anymore.

331
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,410
好 操他妈的要是他以为我会退缩的话
Okay, well, fuck him if he thinks I'm gonna back down.

332
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,190
这就是整首歌的全部意义
That's, like, the whole point of the song.

333
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,820
不过我们得到加里·格利特的同意了
We got the okay from Gary Glitter,

334
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,310
不过他还因为强奸儿童在监狱待着呢 所以这个不太好吧
but he's in jail for child rape, so maybe not the first choice.

335
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,650
这样 听我说
Okay, all right, now listen to me.

336
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,200
走出去 扭转乾坤 好吗?
Go out there, turn this thing around, all right?

337
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,850
那个寡妇还领先你30个点
The widow's beating you by 30 points.

338

344
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,600
乔纳·瑞安 女士 我的早饭在那后面

你真该试试这个牛肉马铃薯饼
You should really try the corned beef hash.

346
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,920
比监狱里方法的任何菜
It's so much more agreeable than anything

347
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,220
都要美味多了
that gets dished out in prison.

348
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,240
比尔 我以为你还在...
Bill. I thought you were in the...

349
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:36,480
监狱? 我的律师帮我上诉否决了
The slammer? My lawyer got it thrown out on appeal.

350
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,580
奥布莱恩聘请我做寡妇谢尔曼的新任竞选经理
O'Brien hired me to be the Widow Sherman's new campaign manager.

351
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,680
- 你别逗我啊 - 没有 丹

352
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,740
在监狱能学到的一件事就是永远别开玩笑
One thing you learn in prison is not to make jokes.

353

我对果糖过敏 你个傻子
I am fructose intolerant, you nitwit.

354
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,960
我现在看到的傻逼局面是专利性的伊根杰作吧
I assume what I'm seeing is the patented Egan touch.

355
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,040
朋友 竞选游说时再会了
I'll see you on the campaign trail, amigo.

356
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,130
告诉总统别见怪
Tell the president no hard feelings.

357
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,930
噢 等等 没错

358
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,760
我倒是很受伤 都快被此吞噬完了
I do have hard feelings. I'm consumed by them.

359
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:00,910
...我们不是在这种情况下
...we're not in this situation.

360

嗯 你那个尖嗓子男朋友怎么了?

368
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,390
他不能去卫生间了?
He couldn't go to the bathroom?

369
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,420
不止是我情感上的事
What it was more about was just my relationships

370
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,530
- 还有我在研究的一种常见形式... - 女士
- and examining a sort of common pattern... - Ma'am.

371
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,040
- 怎么? - 我想... 嗨 凯瑟琳
- Yeah? - I wondered... hey, Catherine.

372
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:27,280
我想我们能谈一下吗?
I wondered if you and I could just have a moment together?

373

- 单独 - 当然
- Privately. - Definitely.

374
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:29,950

汤姆 我不觉得...
Tom, I don't think...

376
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,500
你跟着干嘛?
where are you going?

377
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,340
女士 大家都知道你是一个

382
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,750
不 这样吧
No. You know what?

383
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,690
经过再四考虑 我们还是继续采用之前的计划吧
On third thought, let's just stick with the plan before.

384
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,870
还是援助鲍尔斯丁
We're going to bail out Paulsten.

385
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,390

389
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,450
不然每天紧张地拉什么屎呢
I suppose you need something to nervously shit out.

390
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,440
里昂 每次看到你这张在Tinder[交友app]
Hello, Leon. It's always good to see

391
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,280
最被人左划的脸还是不错的[左划表示没好感]
the most left-swiped face on Tinder.

392
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,410
忙啊 通讯部今天开除了三个人
Busy day. Three people fired from the communications office.

393
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,480
人事变更率很高的部门嘛
High turnover department.

394
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,790
或许是个惊慌失措的大批量解雇呢
Or is a panicky mass firing

395
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,520
因为有人在《政客》上称总统为婊子[又译阴道]?
because someone called POTUS a cunt in "Politico"?

396
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,350

Ah, I just blew the lid off of Cuntgate.

397
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,730
- 这还算不上个门事件 - 不 当然算了
- It's not a gate. - No, it's very much a gate.

398
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,900
- 不是真的 - 你该小心点 艾米
- Untrue. - You should watch out, Amy.

399
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,880
你不会想成为逼门事件的代言人的
You don't want to be the face of Cuntgate.

400
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,990
尽管你的脸非常适合
Although you do have the perfect face for it.

401
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,780
周六 下午 8:15

402
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,810
距股票开市还有37小时

403
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,970
所以已经传到保险公司了?
So it spread to the insurance companies?

404
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,020
- 至少已经三个人了 - 我的天啊
- At least three of them. - Jesus Christ.

405
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,510
又来
Oh, come on.

我刚跟迈克谈了一下
Um, yeah, so I was just talking to Mike

408
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:55,800
我决定要援助韦瑞特
and I definitely want to bail out Wheelright.

409
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,130
这是个更聪明的选择
That's a smart play.

410
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,690
迈克! 你这臭傻逼
Mike! You fucking jagoff.

411
00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:03,690
关于咖啡包的事儿真的很抱歉 我发誓我只是...
Is this about the coffee pods? I swear I was gonna put...

412
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,950
不 是你告诉总统要援助查理的银行
No, you told the president to bail out Charlie's bank.

413
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,460
我没说银行的事啊
No, I didn't say anything about banks.

414
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:09,040
我就跟她说了温蒂付清了
I was talking to her about how Wendy paid off

415
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,720
我的助学贷款 我因此多爱她
my student loans and how I love her for it.

416
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,340
你还没还完学生贷款啊? 你都多大了?
You still have student loans? How old are you?

417
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,480
我不太会理财嘛
I'm not good with money.

418
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,360
市政厅会议

419
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,370

00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,350
- 竞选演讲套路嘛 - 我的信条是多倾听多行动
- Stump speech. - I'm listening and I'm a doer.

423
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:28,760
开头来一个关于当地大咖的笑话 比如现场的布鲁克市长
It's good to start with a joke about a local bigwig

424
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,690
可能效果会很好
like Mayor Brock is here tonight.

425
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,660
比如他得癌症那会 他的医生不得不切除
I guess when he had cancer, the doctors removed

426
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,390
他操自己家保姆的能力
his ability to stop doing his kid's babysitter.

427
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,000
太残酷了吧
Seems kind of harsh.

428
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,340
我了解新罕布什尔的习俗 信我 这是个大笑点

发来一些警告函

431
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,800
斯汀 布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀...
Sting, Bruce Springsteen...

433
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,230
恩雅?
Enya?

434
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,130
给她发一封警告函吧
Send her a fucking cease-and-desist letter.

435
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,040
- 你好 乔纳 - 早上好 谢尔曼女士
- Hello, Jonah. - Good morning, Mrs. Sherman.

436
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,550
我还记得你给你妈妈的那幅
I still remember that lovely macaroni portrait

437
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,920
用空心面拼的肖像画
you made of your mother.

438
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,260
我可不记得什么空心面画像 谢尔曼女士
I don't recall that macaroni portrait, Mrs. Sherman.

439
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,220
- 有请... - 不好意思 女士 该你出场了
- Please welcome... - Excuse me, ma'am. You're on.

440
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,110

谢谢
Thank you.

442
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,440
你听见她用空心粉画像嘲讽我了吗?
Did you hear that dig about the macaroni portrait?

443
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,430
你他妈能相信吗?
Can you fucking believe that?

444
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,620
我们现在有大危机了
Hey, we're on a code black.

445
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,220
总统现在什么疯言疯语都听信 快来
POTUS is on an opinion shopping spree. Come on.

446
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,940
你慢点 我最近在吃可迈丁
Hey, slow down. I'm on Coumadin.

447
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,360
苏 我们要见总统
Sue, we need to see the president.

448
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:24,530
先生们 你们先擦擦汗 耐心等待一下吧
Gentlemen, you'll have to towel off and wait.

449
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,220
- 她在跟别人谈话呢 - 谁?
- She's in with someone. - Who?

450
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:27,060
和谁
Whom.

451
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,610
别犹豫 就查理了
Come on, Charlie, 100%.

452
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,910
- 好啊 - 就这么说定了
- 100%. - All right, great.

453
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,660
不过话说回来 援助你的男朋友
Now, on the other hand, bailing out your boyfriend,

454
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:37,070
会不会结束你的职业生涯啊?
I mean, that could be career-ending, right?

455
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,760
对吼
Yeah, right.

456
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:43,260
但有把枪抵在你的头上...
But, I mean, if you had a gun to your head...

457
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,720
或许枪里没有子弹啊
Oh, maybe the gun doesn't have any bullets.

458
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,670
感谢你的来访
Well, thank you so much for coming.

459
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,590
我的荣幸 先生们
It was my pleasure. Oh, gentlemen.

460
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,580
她真是屁用没有
Well, that was completely useless.

461
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,340
女士 我们得做出最后决定了
Ma'am, we need a final decision right now,

462
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,740
即使它是错误决定
even if it's the wrong one.

463
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,290
我就再需要一丢丢时间
I just need a little bit more time.

464
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,800
如果明天早上我们还拿不出执行方案
If we don't put a plan into action tomorrow morning,

465
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,150
周一我们就变成希腊了
then by Monday we will be Greece.

466
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,220
国家希腊 不是音乐剧希腊
The country, not the musical.

467
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,420
好 我的最终决定是
All right, here's my final decision.

468
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,890
明天早上你们会收到一个最终决定
You will have a final decision by tomorrow morning.

469
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,870
做好两手准备
Have both plans ready to go.

470
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,570
现在我要跟以色列总理电话会谈
Now, I need to get on the phone with the Israeli prime minister

471
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:23,320
接着还有法国总统 好吗?
and then the president of France, okay?

472
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
说不定他们能给我点建议呢
They may give me some insight into this.

473
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,570
女士 与其这样 不如听听我的主意
Ma'am, instead of that, I got an idea.

474
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,240
你现在什么都别想 该咋玩儿咋玩儿
You can clear your head out and have a little fun at the same time.

475
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,840
- 说啥? - 是的 我会打电话给乔纳和丹
- What? - Yeah, I'll call Jonah and Dan

476
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:34,590
然后你就把他们骂得来找不着北
and you can tear them a six-pack of new assholes.

477
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,310
- 听起来很不错呢 - 是的
- Oh, that does sound like fun. Okay. - Yeah.

478
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,540
但是当和你一起度过了47年的丈夫
But when your husband of 47 years

479
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:43,750
在病榻前问你时...
asks you on his deathbed...

480
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,080
丹 现在总统要跟你通电话
Dan, you're on with the president.

481
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,260
丹 我真特么不敢相信
Dan, I cannot fucking believe

482
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,290
你把工作整得一团糟
how terrible you are at your job.

483
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,650
你现在为了调高税收和外阴切开手术
What, are you running on a platform

484
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,080
而奔波演讲吗?
of higher taxes and episiotomies?

485
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:58,170
女士 我们需要一点时间
Ma'am, we just-- we need a little time.

486
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:01,320
让世界上最高那坨垃圾接电话
Put that world's tallest pile of garbage on the phone right now.

487
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:03,550
总统电话
It's the president.

488
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,770
妈的...
Fuck...

489
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,840
- 你好 女士 - 你好啊 驼背大哥
- Hello, ma'am. - Hey, hunchback.

490
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,280
我不知道你每天不忙着赢 反而在瞎逼忙什么
I don't know what you've been doing instead of trying to win,

491
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,120
但是肯定跟屁股和菊花有关系
but I'm gonna guess that it has the word anal in it.

492
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:16,790
你现在学学怎么控制你那舔屌的脾气
Now, you learn to control your cocksucking temper,

493
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,640
否则我就会亲自现身
otherwise I'm gonna come up there myself

494
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,240
然后揍得你满地找牙
and I'm gonna shoot you in your fucking mouth.

495
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:25,150
- 她挂电话了 - 操她妈的
- She hung up. - Fuck her.

496
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,730
塞琳娜·梅耶就是个平庸之辈
You know, Selina Meyer is a second-rate mediocrity

497
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,230
她的唯一成就就是一手搞垮了经济
whose only achievement is single-handedly tanking the economy.

498
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,030
怎么我们成了互相舔菊的傻屌了?
But somehow we're the losers doing anal with each other?

499
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,530
她的总统生涯就是一个接一个的耻辱
Her entire presidency has been one disgrace after another.

500
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,310
- 她从来都不尊重我 - 我他妈的工作还做得不好吗?
- She has never respected me. - And I'm bad at my fucking job?

501
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,930
- 妈蛋！ - 都他妈是狗屁
- Fuck! - You know what? That's bullshit.

502
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,850
- 你做得很好 - 拉倒吧
- You're doing a good job. - Oh, fuck off.

503
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,100
说真的 眼镜啊什么都 高招啊
No, this glasses shit, that was dope.

504
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,120
越看越顺眼 真是个好主意
These look great. That was a great idea.

505
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,730
去你的 真讨厌
Go fuck yourself.

506
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,390
我保证我不会让任何人
And I promise I won't let anyone get away

507
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,060
挥霍你辛辛苦苦的血汗钱
with wasting your hard-earned money.

508
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,040
谢谢你们
Thank you. Thank you so much.

509
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,250
谢谢
Thank you.

510
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:04,420
你给我上去
I want you to go out there

511
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,940
好好地震慑一下新罕布什尔
and I want you to kick some New Hampshire ass.

512
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,800
花岗岩之州 你们好吗
Yo, Granite State. Hey, how you feeling?

513
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,380
布洛克市长今天不在啊[乔纳叫错名字]
I see that Mayor Block isn't here tonight.

514
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,340
是不是因为他不到保姆了[笑话讲错]
Guess he couldn't get a babysitter.

515
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,280
或者其实找到了?
Or could he?

516
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,990
你个怂货 滚回华盛顿把
You suck! Go back to Washington.

517
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,190
我安排了一些激进分子
I took the liberty of arranging some hecklers.

518
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:31,090
- 免费的哟 - 我是来自华盛顿
- No charge. - But, yes, I was in Washington.

519
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:33,260
而且我的职位非常高 职责很重大
And I worked a very high-level, important job.

520
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,570
你是塞琳娜·梅耶搞垮这个国家的帮凶
You helped Selina Meyer screw up this country.

521
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:39,390
把国家搞垮是塞琳娜自己做的好吗
I think she did a fine job screwing up the country all by herself.

522
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,170
不 我是认真的
No, I'm serious.

523
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,290
这比看我自己孩子出生
This is so much more

524
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,310
刺激多了
beautiful to watch than the birth of my child.

525
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,360
对 她一个人就完全搞垮了经济
Right, she single-handedly destroyed the economy,

526
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,810
但是她根本不在乎
but she doesn't care because she's too busy

527
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,020
因为她正忙着跟大款男朋友抱抱呢
cuddling up to her billionaire boyfriend.

528
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,670
我不知道你们怎样
And I don't know about you,

529
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,680
反正我的男朋友可不是大款
but my boyfriend's not a billionaire.

530
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:01,140
她的整个总统任期就是从一个耻辱走向另一个耻辱
Her whole presidency has been one disgrace after another

531
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,590
不知道你是不是受够了
and I don't know if you're sick of it,

532
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:04,330
- 反正我是受够了 - 没错
- but I am definitely sick of it... - Yes.

533
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,160
我可不打算再继续逆来顺受下去了
...and I'm not just gonna sit here and take it anymore.

534
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,640
怎么回事
What the fuck?

535
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,630
我是乔纳·瑞安
My name is Jonah Ryan

536
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,960
我要做你们的议员
and I want to be your congressman.

537
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,070
我不会退缩 谢谢
And I won't back down. Thank you.

538
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,710
谢谢你们 花岗岩之州
Thank you very much, Granite State.

539
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,800

You feeling me? Thank you.

540
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,400
谢谢
Thank you.

541
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,670
周日 上午 9:07

542
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,680
距股票开市还有24小时

543
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,750
- 迈克 迈克 - 韦恩
- Mike! Mike! - Wayne.

544
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,180
什么时候才能知道哪家银行能得到救助资金?
When will we hear which banks are gonna get bailout money?

545
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,920
只有你管那叫救济金 韦恩
No one is using the term bailout money except for you, Wayne.

546
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,970
相关细节会在过后透露
The details for the plan will be revealed later today.

547
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,490
里昂
Leon.

548
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,890
你能证实对通讯部
Can you confirm the allegation of the firing

549
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,200
那三个人的
of three people from the comms

550
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,630
下周二见门的解雇吗[cuntgate逼门事件]
office is tied to See-you-next-Tuesday-gate?

551
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,110
这种这粗俗的语言
That sort of coarse language

552
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,960
简直玷污了这间屋子
is far beneath the dignity of this room.

553
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:46,260
- 而且那玩意不算个门 - 就是个门
- And also it's not a gate. - Oh, it's a gate.

554
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,170
- 就不是  - 就是
- No, it is not a gate. - It's very much a gate.

555
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,730
你猜怎么着 我要让《纽约时报》的
You know what? We're gonna elevate the conversation,

556
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,570
朋友继续提问了
go to my friend here at "The New York Times."

557
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:53,540
迈克 在《政客》的侧边栏上
Mike, the "Politico" Sidebar suggested

558
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:55,480
登出了一则新闻 说一位员工用最恶毒的语言
that there was one staffer who called the president

559
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,280
辱骂了总统女士
the worst thing you can call a woman.

560
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,280
- 为什么有三个人被解雇了 - 好了 提问结束

561

本 整间屋子都在问逼门的事情
Ben, this is real. The whole room was sniffing around Cuntgate.

564
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,440
- 那不算一个门 - 废话!
- It's not a gate, Mike. - No kidding!

565
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,970
这真的不算一个门 我同意 我就说嘛
It isn't a gate. I agree. I said that.

566
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,040
她真的精神错乱了
She's becoming seriously unhinged.

567
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:12,730
她正在向尼克松的方向发展
She has gone full metal Nixon.

568
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,060
你觉得是谁说的
Who do you think said it?

569
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:18,120
好吧 我们说的 我和迈克
Well, we did. Me and Mike.

570
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,370
- 我的天 我以为是我 - 不是吧
- Oh, my God. I thought it was me. - No way.

571
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:21,560
不 我确定我在记者面前
No, I'm pretty sure I called

572

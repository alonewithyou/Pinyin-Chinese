门 关上门
Door. Door.

147

So?

148
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,680
他妈的汤姆是想搞什么幺蛾子?
What the fuck is Tom up to?

149
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,480
他在韩国烧烤店跟珀赛尔碰面是要干嘛?
Why was he meeting with Purcell at a Korean barbecue place?

150
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,180
- 马伍德不是我们这边的 - 他在帮奥布莱恩?
- Marwood is the opposition. - You think Tom is helping O'Brien?

151
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,660
奥布莱恩能给他什么好处?
But what could O'Brien offer

152
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,260
能比过副总统的职位?
him that's better than the vice presidency?

153
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,380
其实什么都比副总统强
Literally anything.

154
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,010
汤姆想当财政部长来着
Oh! Tom wanted Secretary of the Treasury.

155
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,760
不过被我拒了 卧槽
I said no. Ah, fuck!

156
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,280
女士 你只需要继续拉票
Ma'am, you just have to keep nailing down those votes.

157
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,480
再拿下26票我们就赢了
All right? 26 votes and it's over.

158

好吧 伙计们 明天晚上都给我盯着点汤姆

160
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,700
- 有事吗? 我就是瞅瞅
- Yes? - I was just checking

161
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,960
是不是也有什么秘密会议在讨伐我
to see if there was another meeting about me.

162
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,350
今天没有
Not today.

163
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,500

你支持提高债务上限吗?
Would you vote to raise the debt ceiling?

168
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,820
已故伟人莱昂纳尔·里奇曾说
Well, as the late, great Lionel Richie once said,

169
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,540
"这是怎样的滋味 在债务上限狂舞"
"Oh, what a feeling, I am dancing on the debt ceiling."

170
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,090
第一 莱昂纳尔·里奇 还没死呢
Okay, A, Lionel Richie is not dead,

171
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,120
第二 扯那个蛋有鬼用?
B, what the fuck does that even mean?

172
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,790
新罕布什尔喜欢我的段子
New Hampshire loves my zingers.

173
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,260
能有今天 全是靠我的个人魅力
It's my personality that has gotten us this far.

174
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,580
得了吧 那都是靠我才有现在这成绩的
No, I am the one who got us this far,

175
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,200
你这人形灌肠器
you sentient enema.

我在此庄严宣誓 如没有预算补偿
I hereby solemnly promise to never vote

178
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,160
我绝不支持提高债务上限

179
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,340
天知道我每周都恪守日常开支预算

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,340
- 你叫啥来着? - 朱迪·谢尔曼
- What was your name again? - Judy Sherman.

183
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,860
得了吧 理查德之所以胜出
Oh, come on, Richard's only winning because he gets to be

184
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,720
全在于他可以做老好人  但我要坚守本心
the easier person and I have to be me.

185
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,420
好吧 朱迪 扮演下乔纳
All right, Judy, pretend to be Jonah.

186
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,140
理查德根本不可能...
Richard's not gonna get the subtleties of being...

187
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,280
闭嘴 滚那边去!
Just shut the fuck up and move!

188
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,580
在财政职责方面
I'd have to agree with Mrs.

189
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,620
我赞同谢尔曼夫人的观点
Sherman here on fiscal responsibility.

190
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:09,040
事实上 老师 请允许我用这苹果展示一下

194
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,270

198
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,580
当然 这里的城镇不过都是
Granted, every town up here is just

199
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,900
廊桥连起来的两坨脏兮兮的雪堆
two dirty piles of snow connected by a covered bridge,

200
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,660
但是看在耶稣的份上 乔纳 你在这长大的
but Jesus Christ, Jonah, you grew up here.

201
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,850
怎么会不知道这种破事?
How do you not know this shit?

202
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,810
我不知道啊
I don't know. Maybe I was

203
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,080
可能二年级的时候教这个
supposed to learn it in the second grade,

204
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,770
但是我的老师是个臭婆娘
but my teacher was a fucking bitch.

205
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,230
乔纳 注意你的语言
Jonah, watch your language.

206
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,470
看来艾瑞克森在这个活动里放置了眼线

- 理查德 我们有什么眼线监视这个寡妇么? - 没有
- Richard, who do we have tracking the widow? - Nobody.

我不知道你要怎么处理这个
And I just don't know how you want to handle that.

233
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,320
你想像艾伦那样呢[艾伦秀主持人 公开同性恋]
Do you want to just play it like

237
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,650
能低调一些
hoping that we could keep things on the down-low.

她说她从来没完全同意过要公开支持你
She said she never fully agreed to endorse you or support you.

426
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,290
- 她说过 - 然后我说要是我从你的耳朵进去操你脑子
- She did. - And I said maybe you'd remember

427
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,060
你恐怕会记得清楚点
better if I fuck your brain through your ear hole.

428
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,120
然后她怎么说 威尔？
Then what did she say, Will?

429
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,210
他对你火冒三丈 先生
She's pretty furious about it, sir.

430
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,930
- 本 你得去 - 交给我吧
- Ben, you got to - I'm on it.

431
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,650
汤姆为什么在那和耶格聊天
Why is Tom over there chatting it up with Jaeger?

432
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,340
- 不知道 我过去看看 - 不用 不用
- I don't know. I'll handle it. - No, no.

433
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:08,410
不劳您在这展现您不露声色的小魅力了
I don't need your subtle charm on this.

434
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,100
比尔 你好啊
Bill, hi.

435
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,400
我只是想再次确认下你说过会支持我 这话还算数吧
Just wanted to reconfirm that I can still count on your vote.

436
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,810
实际上 总统女士
Actually, Madam President,

437
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,370
我最近认真地拷问了一下自己的灵魂
I've been doing quite a bit of soul searching

438
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,840
恐怕我要听从我的良心了
and I'm afraid I need to listen to my conscience.

439
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,250
良心? 你他娘的在说些啥子?
Conscience? What the fuck are you talking about?

440
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:25,290
在我虔诚地思考后 我决定在接下来的
After much prayerful consideration, I have decided to abstain

441
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,950
国会决胜投票中弃权
from the upcoming congressional tie-breaking vote in Congress.

442
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,580
- 弃权? - 是的 总统女士
- Abstain? - Yes, ma'am.

443
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,940
那就没人赢了 你个蠢蛋
But then no one wins, you dumbass.

444
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,990
有人已经提醒过我你会说些伤人的话的
I was warned that you would say some hurtful things.

445
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,950
好吧 等等 我试试这么说
Okay, hold on. Let me see if I can just explain this to you

446
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,050
看你能不能懂
in terms that you might understand, okay?

447
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:44,890
设想啊 你的办公室主任娜迪亚 对吗?
Let's say that your chief of staff, Nadia, is it?

448
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,960
- 这 - 她跪在你面前
- That’s - Okay, and she's down on her knees

449
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:50,650
手里捧着你的蛋
and she's got your balls in her hand

450
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,690
用你最爽的方式抚慰着你的弟弟
and she's working your shaft just the way you like it.

451
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,520
然后就在你高潮要来
And moments before you're about to come

452
00:16:57,570 --> 00:17:00,750
准别射那斯拉夫傻妞一脸的前一刻
all over her stupid Slavic face,

453
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,170
她说 "不不 经过我虔诚的思考
she says, "Nyet, after much prayerful consideration,

454
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:09,610
我决定在接下来的舔弟弟环节中弃权"
I have to abstain from the upcoming blowjob."

455
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,650
这个比方里 你是娜迪亚吧?
Are you Nadia in this situation?

456
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:15,070
给我有多远滚多远 妈的
Just get out of my sight. Oh, God, fuck.

457
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,670
- 好了 - 让我猜一下 耶格弃权了
- Okay. - Let me guess, Jaeger's abstaining.

458
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,820
- 是 - 尼克尔森也弃了
- Yeah. - Nickerson, too.

459
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,620
汤姆并没有帮奥布莱恩拉票
Tom's not lobbying votes for O'Brien.

460
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:24,330
他是在劝人们弃权
He's asking people to abstain.

461
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,600
这他妈到底怎么回事？
What the fuck is happening?

462
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,630
如果没人能在众议院拿到多数票
If no one gets a majority in the House,

463
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,110
就要到参议院投票表决 大选夜的时候我就解释过了
the vote goes to the Senate. I explained this on election night.

464
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,370
- 我当时没听 - 你是没听 但很明显汤姆听了
- I wasn't listening. - Yeah, but obviously Tom was.

465
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,680
汤姆·詹姆斯是公认的
Tom James is an acknowledged

466
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:35,470
掌握参议院规则和程序的行家
master of the Senate's rules and procedures.

467
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,690
如果到了参议院表决 汤姆就下一任总统了
So if it's up to the Senate, Tom is our next president.

468
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,150
那就必须得阻止他了
Well, he must be stopped.

469
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,450
现在把道尔拉回来还来得及吗
Is it too late to get Doyle back?

470
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,410
- 我们今晚忘了邀请他了 - 好样的
- We forgot to invite him tonight. - Okay.

471
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,830
- 真棒 - 汤姆!
- That's great. - Tom!

472
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:50,460
- 女士 - 格里芬议员 格里芬太太 你好吗汤姆
- Ma'am. - Congressman Griffin. Mrs. Griffin. How are you?

473
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:52,250
- 我很好 谢谢你 女士 - 那就好
- I'm very well, thank you, ma'am. - Good.

474
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,530
我整晚都在观察你 我知道你在打什么算盘
I've been watching you all night and I know what you're up to.

475
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,260
你在努力鼓足勇气邀请我与你共舞?
You're trying to get up the courage to ask me to dance.

476
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,760
我招供
Guilty.

477
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:03,660
女士 与您共舞 荣幸之至
Ma'am, I would be honored.

478
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,490
谢谢你的邀请
Oh, thank you.

479
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,790
谢谢你
Thank you. Hey.

480
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,580
- 你好 - 他邀请我的
- How are you? - He asked.

481
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,890
- 谢谢 谢谢 - 是他邀请我跳的
- Thank you. Thank you. - He asked me.

482
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,860
今晚各种见面 打招呼 寒暄
I think all this meeting and

483
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,050
真是累得我食欲大开啊
greeting has really made me work up an appetite.

484
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:19,950
- 我要饿死了 - 没错
- I'm starving. - Yeah,

485
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,170
你可是从没机会在这种场合吃东西呢
you never get the chance to eat at these things.

486
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,650
从来没有 你知道我最想吃什么吗
Never. You know what I really have a hankering for?

487
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,570
- 啥? - 韩国烤肉
- What's that? - Korean barbecue.

488
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,780
- 你喜欢韩国烤肉吗 - 还可以
- Do you like Korean barbecue? - It's okay.

489
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:31,330
我知道有一家很好吃的店
There's this great place that I heard about.

490
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,500
在安嫩代尔 叫啥名儿来着
It's in Annandale. What is the name of it?

491
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,450
让我好好想想
I'm trying to remember.

492
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:36,590
哦 对了 没错 叫
Oh, right, right. Um...

493
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,380
舔屌叛徒
the Cocksucking Backstabber.

494
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,090
来 接着跳啊 汤姆 别停啊
Oh, keep dancing, Tom. Don't stop dancing.

495
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,080
别到处看了 没人会帮你的
Don't look around. Nobody's gonna help you.

496
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,430
不 别这样 女士 请让我解释一下
No, no. Right. Ma'am, let me explain.

497
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,070
我想 你说的是
What what what that I think you're referring

498
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,380
我想咱还是找个安静的地方私下谈谈吧
You know what? I think maybe we should go and talk in private.

499
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,370
时机刚好 不是吗
That's perfect timing, isn't it? Yeah?

500
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,230
没错
Yes.

501
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,210
- 谢谢你的支持 - 谢谢

502
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,770
- 谢谢大家 - 非常感谢

503
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,590
- 很高兴见到大家 - 过来 别想跑
- So nice to see you all. - Come. You can't get away.

504
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,290
- 我们走吧 - 好吧
- Let's go. Yeah. - Okay. All right.

505
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,010
- 没错 我们要说清楚的 - 谢谢
- Right, we're gonna do it. - Thank you.

506
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,690
你怎么这么蠢 你个狗娘养的阴险小人
How stupid are you, you motherfucking snake?

507
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,170
你跟马伍德和珀塞尔见面的事儿我知道的一清二楚
I know all about your meeting with Marwood and Purcell.

508
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:16,690
我还知道你想用你
I know all about how you're trying to fuck me

509
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,200
那套弃权计划搞垮我
with that abstinence program of yours.

510
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,140
在你这看似光彩
Underneath this whole honorable,

511
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,640
体面 像童子军一样健康的外表下
decent, wholesome Boy Scout crap of yours,

512
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,130
我看得清楚你到底是个啥货色
I know exactly who you are.

513
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,530
- 你知道? - 是的 我当然知道
- Oh, you do? - Yes, I do.

514
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,980
好 所以我不用告诉你
Right, so I don't have to explain

515
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,970
我不是一个会把总统之位
that I am not someone who would piss away my presidency

516
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,950
- 浪费在做一堆操蛋决定上的人 - 啥？
- on a bunch of half-ass decisions. - What?

517
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,150
另外 也绝不会用来操
And, by the way, by messing around with that pretty boy

518
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,330
小美男子查理·贝尔德
Charlie Baird, for God's sake.

519
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,180
查理·贝尔德?
What? Charlie Baird?

520
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,070
关他啥事?
What does Charlie Baird have to do with any of this?

521
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,930
我也不知道 不关他的事
I don't know. He's got nothing to do with it.

522
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,260
- 天哪 你满嘴胡话! - 重点是...
- Oh, my God, you're such a liar! - The point is he...

523
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,890
你就编吧你!
You're such a liar!

524
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:53,310
那你一开始为什么要答应做副总统?
Why did you even join my ticket in the first place?

525
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,180
因为相信为人民服务是正确的
Because I happen to believe in something called public service.

526
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,730
- 放屁! - 那我他妈的也不知道为啥
- Oh, bullshit! - Okay, well, then I got no fucking idea.

527
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,740
- 老娘来告诉你 - 说吧
- I'll tell you why. - Go ahead.

528
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,380
因为你想离总统之位进一步
Because you wanted to be a step closer to the presidency

529
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,050
离我进一步
and to me.

530
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,210
- 呵呵哒 - 你想得不得了 看你的饥渴样
- Oh, my God. - You wanted it so bad, you could taste it.

531
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,120
难以置信 得了吧
This is unbelievable. Please.

532
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,990
你又在撒谎了
You are lying now just like you lied back then

533
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,290
就像之前你撒谎说
just like you lied about

534
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,340
不记得那晚发生在出租车上的事了
that night in the cab with the green shoes.

535
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,110
我简直不知道你在说什么
Oh, well, now I got no idea what you're talking about.

536
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,840
- 呵呵 你懂的 - 我不懂
- Yeah, you know exactly what I'm talking about. - No.

537
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,390
你记得那晚的绿鞋子
You remembered the green shoes that night,

538
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,650
却不记得你想要操我?
but not the fact that you wanted to fuck me?

539
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,260
得了吧
Come on. Come on.

540
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:32,130
直男是不可能记住女生穿的什么鞋的
No straight man remembers a woman's shoes.

541
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,220
得 我承认 我是基佬…
Well, you got me. I'm gay, so...

542
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,530
承认吧 你敢不敢说一次真话?
Just admit it. Just say the truth for once in your life.

543
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,450
汤姆 你那晚就是想操我
Come on, Tom. You wanted to fuck me that night.

544
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,170
- 承认吧你 - 别说了?!
- Just say it. - Will you stop it?!

545
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,530
说吧 说你想干死我
Just say it. You wanted to fuck my brains out.

546
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,520
好吧 我就是想干死你!
All right, I wanted to fuck your brains out!

547
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,110
我就知道 今晚你又想方设法搞我
There you go. And now you're trying to fuck me tonight.

548
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:53,530
- 错了 我今晚就是要搞你 - 我才要搞你
- No, I am fucking you tonight. - I'm gonna fuck you.

549
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,030
辞职对我来说还言之过早呢
I mean, if I never see the White House again, it'll be too soon.

550
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,450
可笑的是 我热爱我的工作
It's funny, you know. I love my job.

551
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,740
我从15议员岁起就在为弗朗工作了
I've been working for Congressman Furlong since I was 15.

552
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,410
迈克 总统在哪?
Mike, where's the president?

553
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,480
- 还有汤姆在哪? - 我不知道
- And where's Tom? - I don't know.

554
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,350
- 你醉了? - 你猜呀 酒鬼先生
- What, are you drunk? - Maybe, Mr. Hipflask.

555
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,540
老子醉了也能工作
Listen, I'm a high functioning alcoholic

556
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:21,550
你就是个烂酒鬼 快点去做事
and you're a sloppy weekend drunk. Now get with it.

557
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:23,710
总统女士 你在吗?
Ma'am?

558
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,450
嗨 我是乔纳·瑞安 今晚很高兴见到你
Hi. Jonah Ryan. Thanks for coming out tonight.

559
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,820

Running for Congress and I hope I can count on your support.

563
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:55,770
这位是我老板波莉 今晚她带我
This is my boss Polly. She's gonna be showing me the ropes today.

564
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,120
波莉 看这个
Oh, Polly, look at this.

565
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,990
大鞋子 这说明什么呢?
Big shoes. You know what that means, right?

566
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,690
大脚丫子?
Uh, big feet?

567
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,810
一针见血啊 你才应该去竞选议员呢
Can't argue with that. Maybe you should run for Congress.

568
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,730
- 你叫乔纳? - 是啊
- Your name is Jonah, right? - Yeah.

569
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:07,520
那你衣服为什么写的乔内·H·瑞安?
So why does your shirt say Jon H Ryan?

570
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:09,980
我草
Fuck.

571
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,540
今晚进展不错
This is good. This is working.

572
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,750
在保龄球馆拉票从来都不会错
Oh, bowling alley's always a good choice.

573
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,960
对男候选人来说 滑冰场虽说也是个好选择
I mean, skating rink's good for a male candidate,

574
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:19,520
但太冷了 都没啥妹子
but it's cold and gals tend to nip out.

575
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,210
- 嗨 我是乔... - 嗨 乔纳
- Hi, I'm Jo... - Hey, Jonah.

576
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,730
麻烦给我双12码的童鞋
Could I get a child size 12, please?

577
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,010
你在这干嘛 泰迪
What are you doing here, Teddy?

578
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,610
我来打保龄球啊
I'm looking forward to some bowling.

579
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:32,700
不过我更喜欢口袋台球呢[隔衣袋手淫]
Although pocket pool is more my game.

580
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:34,690
死变态 你听着
You listen to me, you fucking weirdo.

581
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:38,410
我是被你伤害了 但我不会让你定义我
I was a victim, but I am not gonna let you define me.

582
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:39,710
好演讲啊小妞
Nice blog, Mary.

583
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,140
告诉你 你这种人
You know what? People like you,

584
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,120
虽然有着人的外表 但却是不完整的
you look like us, but there's a little piece missing.

585
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:47,130
你就是个畜生
You're like a different species

586
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,550
老天爷自会惩罚你
and one that I hope gets struck from the Earth

587
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:53,500
你是恶霸 而我 乔纳·瑞安 不会向恶霸低头
because you're a bully and Jonah Ryan stands up to bullies.

588
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,200
乔纳· 瑞安威武
Yes. Yes, he does

589
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,290
谢谢大家 滚吧 这不是你们这些畜生该呆的地方
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, this is a no haters alley.

590
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,530
好了 你和卵蛋爱抚男
Okay, you and Boo-Boo the ball-fondling bear here

591
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,090
快他妈滚出去
have exactly two seconds to get the fuck out.

592
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,090
我们这就走 跟塞琳娜问个好
Our work is done here. Tell Selina hello.

593
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,520
丹 这地方选的不错啊
Yeah, great place for an event, Dan.

594
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,920
厕所贩毒的小屁孩儿们也觉得这地方不错呢
The teenager selling cocaine in the bathroom thought so, too.

595
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,210
你蛋蛋不错嘛 年轻人
Oh, looking good, 26.

596
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,820
白宫东厅

597
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:17,680
总统女士 您看见汤姆了吗?
Ma'am, have you seen Tom?

598
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,810
- 看见好几次了 - 好的
- Couple times. - Good.

599
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,670
我们要搞定尼克森和耶格
I need Nickerson, I need Jaeger,

600
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,610
我们要赢
cause we're gonna finish this.

601
00:23:21,670 --> 00:23:23,070
好的 跟我来
Okay, walk this way.

602
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,160
抓住你了!
Gotcha!

603
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,440
- 嗨 - 嗨
- Hi. - Hi.

604
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:32,220
我能跟你去绿厅说几句话吗?
Can I have a few minutes of your time in the Green Room?

605
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,400
绿厅啊? 看来很有历史意义啊
The Green Room? That sounds historic.

606
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,610
必须的 伍德罗·威尔逊
Oh, it is. It's where Woodrow Wilson

607
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:38,700
在那中风过好几次呢
had some of his most significant strokes.

608
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,650
- 讲真? - 真的
- Really? - Yeah.

609
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,560
- 嗨 兄弟 好久不见 - 迈克
- Hey, buddy. Been a while. - Mike.

610
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,420
真是对不起啊 事情搞砸了
Look, about how things went down at the end, I am so sorry.

611
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,840
我应该谢谢你的 这件事给我敲醒了我
I should thank you, cause it was a wake-up call

612
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,530
让我远离疯狂的特区政治
for me to get out of the insanity of DC politics.

613
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,820
那不错啊 兄弟 这地方糟透了
Amen to that, brother. This place sucks.

614
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,940
我找到了个超棒的私人机构的工作
Listen, I have lined up a sweet private sector gig.

615
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:59,930
悄悄跟你说 我也找到了个工作
Oh? On the QT, I got something in the works, too.

616
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,450
我现在是全国曲棍球联合会的通讯部主管
I am the new director of communications for the NHL.

617
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,800
- 你得到了那工作啊 真好 - 你呢?
- You got the hockey job. Perfect. - Where are you headed?

618
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,420
我要去CL国际时事上班
I'm going to CL International Time.

619
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,200
- 听起来不错啊 - 是的 大公司呢
- That sounds great. - Mmm, big.

620
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,090
兄弟 啥时候需要球赛门票
Listen, any time you want Caps tickets,

621
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,570
就来找我哈
you hit me up, buddy, all right?

622
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:18,330
你要是需要啥国际的东西来找我
And if you ever need anything international.

623
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,740
- 恭喜 - 同喜
- And congratulations. - You, too.

624
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,690
- 祝你好运 - 你也是
- Mazel. Yeah. - Good luck.

625
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,770
混蛋
Fuck.

626
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,470
如果你认为你现在快要
If you think that you are getting

627
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,270
拿到那些一文不值的玩具船
those worthless toy boats now,

628
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,050
那我就要在你在T恤衫上贴钻之前
I'm gonna shut down those factories

629
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,700
关掉那些工厂
faster than you can bedazzle a fucking sweatshirt.

630
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,970
- 废话少说 赛琳娜 - 这就对了
- Let's cut the shit, Selina. - Oh, here it is.

631
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:38,190
我管着科罗拉多州所有路
All roads through Colorado go through me

632
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,870
通行费刚上涨
and the toll just went up.

633
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:42,560
你这是玩斗鸡游戏 而且你还是该死的打头阵的母鸡
You're playing a very dangerous game of chicken

634
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:43,730
这非常危险
with the head fucking hen.

635
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,810
因为如果我没有赢得选举
Cause if I don't win the White House,

636
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,930
奥布莱恩就会把你的破船变成沉船
O'Brien is gonna sink your stupid boats

637
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:51,280
然后你就会穿着90年代的新娘礼服
and you're gonna look like a hair-sprayed asshole

638
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,290
看起来像一只长满毛的肛门
in your 1980s mother-of-the-bride dress.

639
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,610
如果我赢了 我就让自己的部门
And if I do win, I will have my administration

640
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,350
到你的屎一样的破烂地方去
come to your shitty little district

641
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:01,290
像弄死危地马拉的保姆一样弄死你们
and shake it to death like a Guatemalan nanny.

642
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,290
然后我会让美国国家税务局
And then I'm gonna have the IRS crawl so far up

643
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,510
深深地爬到你丈夫的肠子里
your husband's colon, he's gonna wish

644
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:11,730
他得期待他们只找到更多癌细胞
the only thing they find is more cancer.

645
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,750
我的天
Good God.

646
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,740
所以 我能期待你的选票吗？
So can I count on your vote?

647
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,530
或者说我要在你那松弛的 生过六个孩子的阴道里
Or do I need to shove a box of White House M&Ms

648
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,930
塞一盒白宫的M&M豆?
up your stretched-out, six-baby vag?

649
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,450
好 我投给你
Yes, you can count on my vote.

650
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,050
我觉得我更想听到你说
I think I want to hear

651
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:29,500
某问题啦票票来啦
an okey-dokey, Annie Oakley.

652
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,900
某问题啦票票来啦
Okey-dokey, Annie Oakley.

653
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,810
非常好
Oh, super-duper, trooper.

654
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,010
现滚出去吧 议员女士
Now get the fuck out of here, Congresswoman.

655
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,270
艾米 圣诞快乐
Merry Christmas, Amy.

656
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,690
你是凯蒂·卡罗索
Oh, Candi Caruso is who you are.

657
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,330
我很惊讶在内华达事件之后在这里看见你
I'm surprised to see you here after what happened in Nevada.

658
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,950
"内-华-达" 我告诉总统有个更适合
"Nev-add-a." I told POTUS that there are other qualified people

659
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,310
特别顾问的人选
out there for special advisor,

660
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,470
但是她坚持没有了 所以...
but she insisted she couldn't think of any, so...

661
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,530
猜发生了什么
Oh. Guess what.

662
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,230
我订婚了
I am engaged.

663
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:00,640
谁... 和谁订婚？
Who's... who... to whom?

664
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:03,310
盖瑞·威尔什
Gary Welsh. You know, Gary Welsh.

665
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,490
- 盖瑞·威尔什？- 州议员盖瑞·威尔什
- Gary Welsh? - Gary Welsh at State.

666
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,350
他本应该是最性感的50员工表单上的
He was supposed to be on this 50 Hottest thing that I'm in,

667
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:11,130
但是他们把他的名字弄错了 他们拼错了
but they got his name wrong. They spelled it incorrectly.

668
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,900
结果真的有另外一个人叫那个名字
Turns out there's an actual guy by that name.

669
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,330
他们就让那个人当选了
They put him in instead.

670
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,410
- 那真是糟糕 - 非常糟糕
- That's just a bad thing. - Terrible. Terrible.

671
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,710
我很遗憾 但是你订婚我很高兴
I'm sorry to hear that, but happy for you.

672
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,140
- 谢谢 - 那么
- Oh! Thank you. - All that.

673
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,770
总统在呼唤我
President of the United States needs me.

674
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,930
- 所以... - 请便
- So... - Mmm, yeah.

675
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:28,960
保重
Take care.

676
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,400
- 奥佩 拿上你的浣熊皮帽子 我们走 - 好的
- Hey, Opie, grab your coonskin cap and let's get out of here. - Oh, okay.

677
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,480
- 不是你 - 什么?
- It wasn't you. - What?

678
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,330
你一点都不性感 州议员盖瑞·威尔什才是 你是因为印刷错误才当选的
You're not hot. Gary Welsh at State is. You're a typo.

679
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:45,360
但是 正如你所说的 这跟头脑无关 而是与内心有关
But like you said, it's not up here, it's what's in here.

680
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:51,340
- 带我向您的夫人问好 - 好的 女士
- And won't you give my regards to your wife? - Yes, ma'am.

681
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,050
她是威斯康辛州红十字会的负责人 你知道么?
She's the head of the Red Cross in Racine, did you know that?

682
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,930
- 她是一个圣人 - 我会投您一票的，总统女士
- She's a saint. - You can count on my vote, Madam President.

683
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,650
- 这是你的承诺 - 是的 是承诺
- That is a promise. - Oh, yes, it is a promise.

684
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,530
走吧 转身 走
Yes. Go. Turn, go.

685
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,190
我觉得这个聚会
Well, ah, I guess this party

686
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,250
正式结束了 情况如何
is officially now over. So how did we do?

687
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,290
和舞会刚开始时候差不多
We're about the same place we

688
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,750
多了格拉夫的票
were at the beginning of the ball plus Graves.

689
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,010
我们应该能拿到普拉特的选票
We could have secured Platt,

690
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,930
但是他没拿到那张有他夫人设计的包包的照片
but he never got the picture with his wife's purse.

691
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,130
我只希望新罕布什尔州一切顺利
I just hope things are going good in New Hampshire.

692
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:16,270
晚上好 首先我们要展示一些有关国会议员约翰·赖安
Good evening. We begin with some shocking footage

693
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,430
的一些令人震惊的画面
of congressional candidate Jonah Ryan

694
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,750
均由非专业录音机捕获
all captured on amateur video.

695
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,190
我们要提醒各位
We do have to warn you, though,

696
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,750
瑞安的语言十分粗鲁直接
Ryan's language is extremely graphic.

697
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,170
你这种人 虽然有着人的外表
People like you, you look like us,

698
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,910
但却是不完整的
but there's a little piece missing.

699
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,230
你就是个畜生
You're a different species,

700
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,870
老天爷自会惩罚你
one that I hope gets struck from the Earth.

701
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:36,090
我去
Fuck me, Amadeus.

702
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,630
我们都看不见乔纳在吼谁
Can't even see the guy that Jonah's yelling at.

703
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,990
天哪 波莉不会认为我在吼她吧？
God, Polly's not gonna think that I was yelling at her, will she?

704
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,630
我们为什么不打电话给她的宣传人员问问呢?
Why don't we call her publicist and find out?

705
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,400
等等 理查德
Wait a second. Richard,

706
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,810
你一定有从另一个角度拍摄的视频吧
tell me you have that from the other angle.

707
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,970
当然
Oh, definitely.

708
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,370
乔纳 我要一个儿童款12码的
Hey, Jonah. I'll get a child size 12, please.

709
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,030
你在那干什么
What are you doing here?

710
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,750
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

711
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,790
我不知道发生了什么
I don't know what happened there.

712
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,170
- 你又他妈搞砸了 - 一模一样的混蛋事
- You did the same fucking thing! - Literally.

713
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,130
你知道么
Oh, yeah, you know what?

714
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,790
你是对的 确实是一模一样的
You're right, I did the exact same thing.

715
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,990
大选之后
After the national elections,

716
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,650
总统经历了一些困难
the president may have found herself with a bad lie in the rough,

717
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,610
但是待经济稳定之后
but after stabilizing the economy,

718
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:12,010
众议院投票就开始像打高尔夫球
the House vote is starting to look like a gimme putt.

719
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,470
记住我的话 总统将最终拔得头筹
And mark my words, the president will end up atop the leaderboard

720
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,570
就像朴英碧和高宝璟
just like Inbee Park or Lydia Ko

721
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,590
或者其他美国女子职业高尔夫巡回赛中
or any of the other great female golfers

722
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:23,530
优秀的高尔夫球女选手
in the LPGA Tour.

723
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,970
我想回到
I would like to get back to questions

724
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,250
总统女儿的同性恋问题
about the first daughter's lesbianism.

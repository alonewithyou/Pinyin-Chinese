...你要准备好演生气离席
...you are simply ready to perform the walkout

161
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,280
让他们相信你不会再协商了
to convince the Chinese that you will not negotiate

162
00:05:58,340 --> 00:05:59,980
如果合议的条款不尽如人意

- 她从来没这样过 - 本可以
- She never does this. - Ben can do that.

169
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,390
- 谁? 我? - 实际操作起来比听起来难多了
- Who, me? - It is much harder than it sounds.

170
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,100
- 我们排练一下? - 当然
- Perhaps we should rehearse? - Absolutely.

171
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,540
我们不接受
So this is unacceptable.

172
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,740
然后 我走出去
And then, uh, I walk out.

173
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,820
太假了 再来一遍
No, that is not credible. You try again.

174
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,540
我们无法接受
This is unacceptable.

175
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:31,020
还是一样 只是响了点
No, you see, that's the same, but it's just louder.

176
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,200
她从来没这样过
She never does this.

177
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,180
这个不错 很真实啊
no, that is good. Now, that is convincing.

Oh, my God. Minna, seriously,

436
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,560
那完全是个无心之失
that was a complete honest mistake.

437
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,850
凯瑟琳只是一时迷失
Catherine was just confused.

438
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,130
但作为妈妈 却没有阻止她
But you are her mother. You did not stop her.

439
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:53,200
我要怎么阻止她啊? 我只能让她做完啊
How could I have stopped her? I had to let her finish.

440
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,510
你也是个母亲 你有个儿子
You're a mother. You've got a son.

441
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,340
你肯定也这样做过吧
I'm sure you've done it before.

442
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,070
- 你也经历过啊 - 并没有
- You've been in this position. - No, I have not.

443
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,210
这种事在冰岛偶尔会有
This happens occasionally in Iceland,

444
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,800
但在那也纯属意外
but there it's just an accident.

445
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,820
我去 他们从一开始真正想要的是这个
God, this was their real demand from the beginning.

446
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,190
这些岛可不是突然出现的
I mean, those islands didn't come out of nowhere.

447
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,220
事实上 这些岛就是突然出现的
Actually, they did. The Chinese created islands

448
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,090
中国靠在海底沉积物上打桩来创造岛屿...
by piling sediment from under the sea...

449
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,460
总统女士 你不能割给他们这些岛屿
Madam President, you can't give them these islands.

450
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,020
这会动摇整个地区的
It'll destabilize the whole region.

451
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,360
麻烦你再去跟歧将谈谈...
Will you please go and talk to Chi-Jang and try...

452
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,820
我试试 但是我不知道
I will try, but I don't know

453
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,820
他能听进去多少
how much I'm going to be able to get his ear.

454
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,470
但是你要做的就是让他听进去一个词
But what you're gonna need to do is let him get a word in.

455
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,780
你知道吗? 这
Okay, well, you know what? This

456
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,510
让我想起了印度和不丹的谈判
reminds me of negotiations between India and Bhutan.

457
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,300
我就知道会这样
Okay, this is what I'm talking about.

458
00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:32,910
不丹态度强硬
Bhutan was being stubborn.

459
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,680
我得去看看我的另一个舞伴了
So, I've got to go check on my other prom date.

460
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,360
- 不好意思 - 啥事? - 你知道在哪能
- I'm sorry. - Yes? - Do you know where I can get

461
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,390
买到这种超好吃的中国口香糖吗?
any more of this amazing Chinese gum?

462
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,380
- 这是尼古丁口香糖 - 不是吧
- It's nicotine gum. - Oh, no.

463
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,960
与中方会谈

464
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,970
下午 4:47

465
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,830
这也改变不了
Well, that does not change the fact

466
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,350
我们的日本朋友
that our friends in Japan

467
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,810
在钓鱼岛也有主权的事实
still have claims to the Diaoyu Islands.

468
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,940
陆总统坚持你方
President Lu says dropping your objections

469
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,500
不得对任何交易持有异议
must be part of any deal.

470
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,380
我们无法接受
Well, that is unacceptable.

471
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,090
- 无法接受! - 她从来没像这样过
- Unacceptable! - She never does this.

472
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,580
我会冲出去 我这就冲
I mean, I will storm out. Here I go.

473
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,430
没门 无法接受的!
No way. It's unacceptable!

474
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,560
不可能
This is not happening.

475
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,720
坦白讲 她从来没这样过
In all honesty, she's never done this.

476
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,040
我不知道中文怎么说...

477
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,080
但是梅耶总统的女人果子在腐烂[指更年期]

478
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,070
我知道两百万听起来好像很多 宝贝儿
I know two million sounds like a lot, sweetie.

479
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,750
但其实不多 这只是为拯救
It's not. It's a small price to pay

480
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,100
巴西雨林所要付出的小小代价
to save the Brazilian rain forest.

481
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,180
但是你不是要砍掉雨林
But aren't you cutting down

482
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,450
来建度假村吗?
the rain forest in order to build the resort?

483
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,250
这样我们就能好好保存没砍的啦
So we can conserve the rest.

484
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,920
这是良性循环
It's a virtuous cycle.

485
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,530
听起来很有道理呢
Well, I guess that makes sense.

486
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,530
- 嗨 妈妈 - 你两在这儿大老远的干嘛呢?
- Hi, Mom. - What are you guys doing all the way out here?

487
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,620
我们等会再谈吧
We can talk about this later.

488
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,630
我会在你枕头上放些宣传册的
I'll leave the pamphlets on your pillow.

489
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,810
- 谢谢 爸爸 - 亲爱的 待儿会见
- Thanks, Dad. - Darling. Lee.

490
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,930
听我说
Okay, listen to me.

491
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,830
如果你需要钱方面的建议
If you want to get advice or talk about money,

492
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,660
你来找我 好吗?
you can come to me, okay?

493
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,420
我手下可有一整个财政部门呢
I've got the whole Treasury Department.

494
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,770
而且他们 你懂得...
And they're, you know...

495
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,880
好吧 不管怎么说他们之前也辉煌过
they've been better, I realize.

496
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:18,320
虽然你爸爸爱你 宝贝儿
I mean, Daddy loves you, sweetheart,

497
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,010
但他就是个骗子
but he's a crook.

498
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,580
- 我知道 - 对吧?
- I know. - Right?

499
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,000
- 不好意思 - 我只是觉得我可以...
- Oh, excuse me. - I just thought I could...

500
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,620
我不是有意要打扰你们的亲密时刻的
I don't mean to interrupt an intimate moment,

501
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,930
只是谈判
it's just that there have

502
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,460
取得了重大进展
been seismic developments in the negotiations.

503
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,260
你让中方领导阵脚大乱了
You have really rattled the Chinese leaders.

504
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
中方领导?
Chinese leaders?

505
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:36,170
- 是的 凯瑟琳 - 有没搞错啊 妈妈?
- Yes, Catherine. - Seriously, Mom?

506
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:36,760
我感觉他就快要动用
I think he is going to use the

507
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:39,200
那支第二次海牙会议的金笔了呢
gold pen from the Second Hague Convention very soon.

508
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,340
你妈妈给了中方领导一支超棒的钢笔
Your mother has given an amazing pen to the Chinese leaders.

509
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,280
- 是金色的... - 她知道... 她知道那笔长啥样
- It's gold... - She know... she knows about that pen.

510
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,810
你简直糟糕透了
You are so terrible.

511
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,500
- 凯瑟琳 - 别叫我
- Catherine. - No.

512
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,130
- 凯瑟琳 这下好了 - 真是抱歉
- Catherine. Okay. - Sorry.

513
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,480
生她的时候就已经像一场噩梦了
Even labor and delivery with her was a nightmare.

514
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,420
是吗? 为什么?
Oh, yes? Why is that?

515
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:56,760
你阴道很窄吗?
You have a very narrow vagina?

516
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,690
是紧 在美国我们说紧
Well, tight. In the States we say tight.

517
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,290
中国经济现状比任何人想的都要糟糕
The Chinese economy is in a worse state than anyone realized.

518
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,160
这些制裁真的在削弱中国的经济
These sanctions, they are really crippling them.

519
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,350
而且岐将这个人 他高傲又固执
And Chi-Jang, he is a proud, stubborn man.

520
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,930
中国版的达西先生[《傲慢与偏见》男主为人高傲冷漠]
Like a Chinese Mr. Darcy.

521
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,660
不过也蠢兮兮的 像中国版的宾利先生[《傲慢与偏见》中的角色 有点呆笨]
But stupid also, like a Chinese Mr. Bingley.

522
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,850
我爱《欢乐满人间》
I love "Mary Poppins."

523
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:15,070
因此 如果美国取消对中国的制裁
So if the United States lifts the sanctions

524
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,690
并有意在接下来的25年
and is prepared to meet their demands for industrial metals

525
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,340
与其在工业金属方面的要求达成一致
for the next 25 years, the Chinese might--

526
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,500
中国方面也许 可能 会就西藏问题进行协商
might be prepared to discuss Tibet.

527
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,860
- 吸什么脏了? - 等等 商讨解放西藏?
- To bet on what? - Wait, to talk about freeing Tibet?

528
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,160
不不 他们准备框架协议的协商
No, they are prepared to discuss a framework for talks

529
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,620
是为了探索民族自治的可行性方案
aimed at a possible path to self-determination.

530
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,170
- 我要成为解放西藏的人了? - 不 并不是解放
- I'm freeing Tibet? - No, no, not free.

531
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,440
这应该跟在香港实行的一国两制差不多
It would likely be one country, two systems similar to Hong Kong.

532
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,850
- 对 没错 - 博诺要操翻自个儿的墨镜了(保罗·大卫·休森 政治歌手戴墨镜为经典造型)
- That's it. - Bono's gonna shit his sunglasses.

533
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:46,060
这简直是人类登上月球一样的历史性时刻
That is like some man on the moon legacy shit.

534
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,850
我的天啊 我赛琳娜·梅耶尔 解放西藏的女人
My God, Selina Meyer, the woman who freed Tibet.

535
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,500
不... 不是 都说了不是解放
Not... no, really, not free.

536
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:54,220
那俄亥俄州的工厂怎么办?
What about the factories in Ohio?

537
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:56,180
在最新一轮投票中 乔纳都遥遥领先

539
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,690
- 去你妹的! - 讲真 不是解放
- Fuck it! - Really, not freeing.

540
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,580
显然 这对于
It is, of course, tragic

541
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:05,380
俄亥俄州和北卡罗来纳州的失业者是个不幸的消息
for the unemployed workers of Ohio and North Carolina.

542
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:07,080
他们应该自己努力上大学的
Well, they should have tried going to college.

543
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,460
担心你们芬兰自己的失业问题吧
Worry about your own unemployment in Finland.

544
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,820
芬兰不存在失业问题

545
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,100
各位 那个该死的诺贝尔和平奖要归我了

这是个...
This is a...

580
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:51,270
极具传统文化底蕴的
culturally significant and traditional...

581
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:53,480
- 自由原木蛋糕 - ...自由原木蛋糕

582
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:57,220
我们来切开一起分享吧
Why don't we slice that up for everyone to enjoy?

583
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,100
你知道 我们准备好了要发表声明
You know, we have a statement that is ready for release.

584
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:06,410
不能发表声明
There will be no statement.

585
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:08,640
这些议题都太过敏感
These are very delicate issues

586
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:09,980

589

然而 也许像西藏这么重大的议题
Although, perhaps when things are as significant as Tibet,

590
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,980
一不小心就被媒体知道了
things are accidently leaked to the press

591
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,690
这样一来全球都会知道我们的成就
so that the world may know of our accomplishments.

592
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,580
如果同时有传言指出 你在中国黑客攻击美国问题上
It would be very unfortunate if it also leaked

593
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:37,540
欺骗了全国人民 那可就非常不幸了

594
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,280
这指责太荒谬了
That is ridiculous.

595

我们手上有你的邮件作证
We have your emails to prove it.

596

- 险胜 - 我的天呐!

618
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,730
不过还是可以视为天启的祥瑞

还记得没有人愿意当接球手吗?

那种专门给喜欢哭丧着脸的人们拍的影片

你对选举平局有什么看法?

131
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,730
有一天晚上我好不容易闭上了眼睛
You know, at night when I dare to close my eyes,

132
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:42,270
比尔 艾瑞克森

我梦到你母亲输掉了
I dream about your mother losing

136
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,290
遇见她举着硬纸板指示牌
at the bottom of a highway exit ramp.

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,770
如果我是汤姆·詹姆斯
Now, if I were Tom James,

138
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:47,940
我就直接弄到三个州
I would just try to get three states to

139
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,480
然后弃权去参议院
abstain and then it would go to the Senate,

140
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,030
为美国历史上
serving the president the most abject humiliation

141
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,610
最难堪耻辱的总统服务
in the history of the United States.

142
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,170
你知道硬纸板牌子上写了什么吗?
You know what the cardboard sign says?

143
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:56,610
写了什么?
What does it say?

144
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,540
写着 "我太抱歉了 比尔·艾瑞克森"
It says, "I'm so sorry, Bill Ericsson."

145
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,480
如果你落选了会怎么办?
What if you lose the presidency?

146
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,670
让我告诉你
Well, I'll tell you something,

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,540
你不能这么想
you can't think that way.

148
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,710
我妈总是这么说
That's what Mother always said.

149
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:10,470
当你有消极的情绪时
When you have those kinds of negative feelings,

150
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,450
你就把它们捡起来塞进盒子里
you just pick them up and you stuff them in your box

151
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,010
再把盒子紧紧关上
and you close it down tight and you take that box

152
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,350
把盒子推到最里面...
and you shove it way back here in your...

153
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:24,120
脑袋的角落里 再把钥匙吞掉
in the corner of your head and swallow that key.

154
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,890
然后它们一下子就不见了
And then, poof, they're gone.

155
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,100
就是这样 它确实管用 宝贝
And then that's it. And it works, too, sweetie.

156
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,390
这是我妈说过管用的方法
That's something that Mother told me that works.

157
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,810
把热水倒进壶里 没问题吧?
Okay, you pour the hot water into the pot, all right?

158
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,660
盖瑞 沃尔什

159
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,670
总统梅耶的特别助理和私人助手

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,090
稍微晃一晃
Swirl it around a bit.

161
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,450
再把热水倒出去 好吗?
And then you pour it out, okay?

162
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,840
这就叫给壶预热
That's called hot in the pot.

163
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,180
现在这个是我的招牌混合茶
Now this is a special blend I've got.

164
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,630
里面有洋甘菊 蔷薇果
It's got chamomile and rose hips

165
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,030
以及其它一些我不会在镜头面前
and some other little special ingredients

166
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,650
告诉你的特殊的配方
that I'm not gonna tell you on camera.

167
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,210
我的问题是
My question was

168
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,490
你对金融危机有什么看法
what's your take on the financial crisis.

169
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,140
我就是觉得他们钱不够了
I just think they ran out of money.

170
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,790
他们应该再印一些出来
They should probably just print more.

171
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,210
我不懂这算什么大问题
I don't know why it's been such a big issue.

172
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,990
好了 各位 话说我们什么时候炒了麦克?
Okay, guys, when are we gonna fire Mike, by the way?

173
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,260
他真是操蛋事不断啊
Because it is seriously just one fuckup after fuckup with him.

174
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,690
是啊 就职典礼之后
Yeah, right after the inauguration,

175
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,050
我们就把麦克屎托克先生请出门去
we'll show Mr. McShittock the door.

176
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,050
我热爱自己的工作
I love my job.

180
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,810
尤其这份工作
Especially because this is the kind of job

181
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,950
每年都可以让我不断进步
that I've gotten better at every year.

182
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,470
而且工作时
And it's also the kind of job

183
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,670
你必须办事迅速
that you need to be fast on your feet.

184
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,410
要雷厉风行 还有就是那种
You need to be quick and you need to sort of,

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,830
我词穷了
uh, I don't even know what the word is.

186
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,200
我们现在正忙着把客房改造成育儿室
We're in the process of converting the guest bedroom

187
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,030
迎接来自中国的小天使
into a nursery for our arriving Chinese angel.

188
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,150
在这儿我们贴了个山寨小熊维尼
We went with a Winnie the Pooh knockoff.

189
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,670
中国制造 可以给埃伦营造家的感觉
It's made in China so Ellen will feel right at home.

190

我想他是叫"快乐太阳熊"

191
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,730
比美国的便宜多了 我们还检测了屋子含铅量
So much cheaper. And we've checked the room for lead,

192
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,710
我要... 应该是我来检测
so there's... actually, I need... I'm supposed to check...

193
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,810
我得找个人检测这屋子的含铅量
I have to get a guy to check the room for lead,

194
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,830
我们一定会查的

195

竞选经理

201
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,490
这意味着平局或许将被打破
which meant the tie might not be a tie any longer.

202
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,200
- 我改主意了 - 关于什么?
- I've changed my mind. - About what?

203
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,810
派我去内华达吧 我想去
Send me to Nevada. I want the job.

204
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,630
可是凯蒂·卡罗索也想去
Oh, but so does Candi Caruso.

205
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,350
而且 尽管如此 她说
And even though, and I quote,

206
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,890
我是个女人 这一事实
the fact that I'm a woman

207
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,830
意味着我们再也不会有其他女总统了
means we will no longer have any women presidents

208
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,010
因为我们尝试过了 但她太坑爹了
because we've already tried one and she fucking sucked.

209
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,330
求你了 求求你
Please, please, please.

210
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,730
好吧 我可以告诉你这点..
Well, I'll give you this...

211
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,770
凯蒂·卡罗索才不会去给这堆烂事擦屁股
Candi Caruso would not eat this amount of shit.

212
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,170
除非她之后跑到浴室隔间
Unless afterward she went into a bathroom stall

213
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,710
用的还是老式的两指木片切削机
and used the old two-fingered wood chipper.

214
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,170
如果可以选择你
Why would I want to stand next to a twig

215
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,170
我怎么会想跟那样的弱鸡去虚度光阴呢?
like that all day when I can stand next to you?

216
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,870
你要是输了会怎么办?
What would you do if you lost?

217
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,280
你真是死咬着这个话题不放啊
You keep harping on this.

218
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,430
但我告诉你 我是输过竞选的
But I'll tell you something, I have lost elections.

219
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,990
我首次竞选国会议员时就输了
I lost the first time that I ran for Congress.

220
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,230
还被他们叫做赛琳娜·范德比尔特
They called me Selina Vanderbilt

221
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,490
好像那些范德比尔特还剩多少钱似的
as if the Vanderbilts had any money left.

222
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:49,960
不管怎样 在那之后 你也知道
Anyway, after that, you know,

223
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,190
我去了亚利桑那州的一个温泉浴场
I went to Arizona to a spa

224
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,530
我扪心自问 思考了几个棘手问题
and I took stock and I asked myself some tough questions...

225
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,750
等等  你是在那时候精神崩溃的吗?
Wait, is that when you had your nervous breakdown?

226
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,100
不不 我没有...
No, no, I did not...

227
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,950
不 我是去做温泉疗养 甜心
no, I went to a spa, sweetie.

228
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,320
因为当时你进精神病院了
No, when Rosa had to take care of me

229
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,320
不得不让罗莎来照顾我
because you went to a mental hospital.

230
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,550
不 亲爱的 我并没有进精神病院
No, darling, I didn't go to a mental hospital.

231
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,410
我去的是温泉浴场
I went to a spa.

232
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,280
你那电影就会这样把所有事都记录下来吗?

- 11-10, O'Brien. - I just talked to Furlong.

237
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:23,120
梅耶:10 奥布莱恩:11

238
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,390
他说一切都在掌控之中
He said everything's under control plus a bunch of stuff

239
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,110
外加一堆菊花精液之辞 还有我可爱的嘴
about assholes and jizz and my pretty mouth.

240
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:27,350
理查德 乔纳在哪儿?

245
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,090
我找不到自己的衣服了
I couldn't find my clothes.

246
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,730
不得不从她爸衣柜里找身衣服
I had to get this out of her dad's closet.

247
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:38,510
她原来说的是她在乔治敦大学读大四
She already told me she was a senior at Georgetown.

248
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,390
结果她指的是乔治敦日间学校
Turns out she meant Georgetown Day School.

249
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,850
她是数学竞赛队的
She's on the math team.

250
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,130
- 你在拍我? - 这可能算得上犯罪了

哦对 凯瑟琳找我帮她

来拍摄竞选二三事

253
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,370
而且我还跟她学会怎么录像了

254
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,330
好吧 真棒 那在这历史性的一天...
Oh, okay, good, well, then on this historic day...

- 还有 总统在线上 - 我操你妈的
- Also, the president's on the line. - Oh, motherfuck.

256
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,170
- 乔纳 听得到我吗? - 听得见 女士

00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,340
铅 还是个问题
The lead, still a problem.

637

等等 我们不能做什么吗?
Wait, though, isn't there anything that we can do?

654
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,800
不行 你得获得全票才能取胜
No, you'd have to run the table now to win.

655
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,760
我们不可能得到26票
There's no way you can get to 26.

656
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,930
但如果我们得到弗吉尼亚州的票呢?
But what if we get Virginia?

657
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:18,680
你拿不到那个州的票

如果我们拿到西弗吉尼亚呢?
What if we get West Virginia?

- Oh, Christ. O'Brien's only got 22. - Yeah.

665
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,060
他应该得不到26票
I mean, I don't think even he can get to 26.

666
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,030
看来汤姆·詹姆斯
Looks like we're looking

667
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,820
要成为总统了

你能再给我解释一下规则吗?

我很抱歉 妈
I'm really sorry, Mom.

671
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,800
别着急 女士
Hey, don't worry, ma'am.

672
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:51,240
四年以后你还能再竞选
You can run again in four years, you know?

673
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,410
如果汤姆·詹姆斯当上总统的话就不行
Not if Tom James is president, I can't.

674
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,370
...华盛顿投给比尔·奥布莱恩
...Washington votes for Bill O'Brien.

675
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,030
华盛顿投给比尔·奥布莱恩
Washington votes for Bill O'Brien.

676
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,210
- 行了 大家都出去 - 好的

677
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,550

除了你 艾米
Except you, Amy.

679
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,430
天啊 走吧 走吧
Oh, God, come on, come on.

680
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,710
好 听着
Okay, look.

681
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,170
现在给那个小人得志的乔纳打电话
Get that clowntard Jonah on the phone right now.

682
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,670
如果我们让他投给奥布莱恩呢?
What if we tell him to vote for O'Brien?

683
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:27,870
女士 你不能这么做 他是在野党...
Ma'am, you can't do that. He is the opposition--

684
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,950
这是我他妈唯一能做的事了 艾米
It is the only fucking thing that I can do, Amy.

685
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,530
真的
Seriously.

686
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,890
如果奥布莱恩赢得总统之位
If O'Brien wins the presidency,

687
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,770
我可以和他对着干四年
I can run against him in four years.

688
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,750
但如果汤姆·詹姆斯赢了
But if Tom James wins,

689
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,190
他就会当八年总统啊 艾米 八年
he's gonna be president for the next eight years, Amy. Eight!

690
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,970
12年 女士
12, ma'am.

691
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,890
汤姆的第一个任期不算在内
Tom's first term won't count

692
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,070
因为严格来说他会是晋升的副总统
because technically he'll be an elevated vice president.

693
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,370
但我听起来像肯特 所以
But I sound like Kent, so...

694
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,570
我的天啊 12年里

00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,170
我会成为干瘪老太婆的
I'm gonna be a shriveled-up can of ass.

696
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,910
讲真 我不能 我的政治机会
Seriously, I can't-- I mean, my political window

697
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,110
会在我穿不了无袖裙的一刻关上
just slams shut the second I can't wear sleeveless dresses.

698
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,550
马上打电话给乔纳 让他投票给奥布莱恩
Call Jonah right now and tell him to vote for O'Brien.

699
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,590
打扰下 议院会议厅在哪儿?

00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,290

你最好是对的
You better be right.

他们要关闭投票了
They're gonna close the vote.

00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:28,850
梅耶:21 奥布莱恩:25 弃权:3

708
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,550
- 奥布莱恩25票 - 他就差一票了
- O'Brien 25. - He's one away.

709
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,470
拜托 上帝 把约拿送到国会去
Please, God, deliver Jonah to Congress

710
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,490
然后随便给他个癌症 我不在乎

711
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:36,770
- 马乔里? 我不想和你说话 - 我很抱歉

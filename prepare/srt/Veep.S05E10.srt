00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,500
我想的是副总统
I was thinking vice president.

34
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,720
这真的是最低要求了
That's literally the least you can do.

35
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,100
我就想要国务卿
And I really want secretary of state.

36

也不愿意做汤姆的狗屁副总统
his zombified wooden asshole twice a day

48

00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,220
那副总统这条路就先放放
Okay, let's put a pin in the VP for now.

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,080
- 逗我呢? - 早上好 女士
- Seriously? - Morning, ma'am.

51
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,820
叫醒迈克 或者算了 反正醒不醒都一样

肯特 下次你决定从菊花进来的时候
Kent, can you give a girl some warning next time

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,960
给人家个提醒先吧?

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,160
数据不做提醒的 女士
Data gives no warning, ma'am.

现在您已不再掌权
that the Chinese are rather nervous about moving forward

110
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,060
恐怕中国人无意进一步与您就西藏问题进行洽谈
with Tibet now that you're out of power.

111
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,960

- 我已经决定... - 别 别说

你已经决定分毫不剩地
You have decided to throw away

137
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,600
抛弃所有的尊严
every last shred of dignity you have

你可不会是个普普通通的副总统
You are not just gonna be any vice president.

143
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,300
你将成为我的搭档...
You're gonna be a partner...

144

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,280
我很高兴地宣布
and I'm happy to say

293
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,700
他会全力支持我
he's fully endorsing my presidency,

294
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,920
我会好好利用他的帮助...
so I will be counting on his help...

295
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,040
我想吃水果
I need fruit.

296
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:52,240
我会带领美国走出这段混乱的时期
as I guide America out of these turbulent times.

297
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,350
国会代表将不会再次投票

298
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:56,390
十天后

299
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:56,400
距就职典礼还有1天

300
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,840
这就是她啦 我的宝宝 艾伦
Here she is, baby Ellen.

301
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:58,000
她看起来真的太大了 不像是个宝宝
Yeah, she seems really, really large for a baby.

302
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,720
我三岁的时候也是个大宝宝
I was a tall kid when I was three.

303
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,560
我们那的邻居
In fact, people in the

304
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,000
都以为我是不是有啥问题
neighborhood thought something was wrong with me

305
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,600
因为我简直是个五岁孩子的个头
cause I was the size of a five-year-old.

306
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,860
所以你到底是哪出了问题呢?
So what's the reason now, then?

307
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,400
早安 总统女士 我回来了
Morning, Madam President. I am back.

308
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,040
- 你之前不在这儿? - 我去了内华达六天
- Were you gone? - Nevada. Six days.

309
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,060
那是段不错的旅程
Yeah, it was a really, really amazing visit.

310
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,480
这是我奶奶的画
This is Mee-Maw's painting back

311
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,840
给我送回家去
here and I want to make sure to get this home.

312
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,680
好的 不过严格来讲 那是凯瑟琳的
Okay, that's technically Catherine's painting.

313
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:24,130
罗伯特 理查德

314
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,140
文稿代理公司

315
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,700
- 嗨 - 哈喽
- Hey. - Hello.

316
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,980
你也是来推销青年小黄书点子的吗?
Are you here selling a young adult fiction idea, too?

317
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,340
我的讲的是在一个平行宇宙里
Mine takes place in an alternate timeline

318
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,220
那里的肥胖酗酒前总统幕僚长
where overweight, alcoholic ex-chiefs of staff

319
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,760
被人抢着上
are considered a sexual prize.

320
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,560
平行宇宙无非是
Alternate timelines are a crutch

321
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,580
给敷衍的科幻提供个大背景 比如 《星际迷航》
for lazy sci-fi premises, e.G., "Star Trek"

322
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,980
除了《深空九号》
with the exception of "Deep Space Nine."

323
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,920
你该试试写浪漫小说
You should try your hand at romance novels.

324
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,870
- 我试过 - 哦
- I have. - Mmm.

325
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,340
你听说蒙特兹
You hear Montez is looking

326
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,800
想要留下一位高级白宫职员了吗?
to keep one senior White House staffer?

327
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,880
大概就是个谣言吧 不在乎
Probably just a rumor. Wouldn't worry about it.

328
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,450
就职典礼前夜

329
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,460
下午 8:17

330
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,340
按照惯例 总统当选人蒙特兹女士
As is customary, President-Elect Montez

331
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,460
和她的家人今晚将下榻布莱尔大厦
and her family will spend tonight at Blair House.

332
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,880
明早10点 她将在就职典礼前
Tomorrow morning at 10:00 A.M., she will join President Meyer

333
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,640
与梅耶总统在红厅
for coffee in the Red Room

334
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,960
喝咖啡
before heading to the inauguration.

335
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:11,820
白宫

336
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,820
下午 10:49

337
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,680
MSNBC刚刚获知总统当选人蒙特兹女士
MSNBC has just learned that President-Elect Montez

338
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,050
蒙特兹欲挖查理·贝尔德任财政部长

339
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,220
计划提名华尔街银行家查理·拜尔德...
plans to nominate Wall Street banker Charlie Baird...

340
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,380
果不其然
That seems about right.

341
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,220
为财政部长
to be her secretary of the treasury.

342
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,740
梅耶总统去年年底和这位银行家短暂有染
President Meyer dated the banker briefly late last year.

343
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,360
嘿 理查德
hey, Richard.

344
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,360
总统女士
Madam President.

345
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,560
我在打包收拾议员的旧办公室
I'm just finishing packing up Congressman Ryan's old office.

346
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,380
必须现在做 因为这是最后一晚...
I have to do it now because it's the last night before...

347
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,140
对啊 我知道是什么的最后一晚
Yeah, I know what it's the last night before of.

348
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,090
你知道柯尔特的生日宴会吗
You know about Colt's birthday dinner?

349
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,580
- 这样很好 不是吗 -非常 非常 非常放松
- It's good, isn't it? - It's very, very, very relaxing.

350
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,360
我应该更信赖你 理查德
I should have relied on you more, Richard.

351
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,060
我是说真的 你算是个好员工
I mean, really, seriously, you're one of the good ones.

352
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
谢谢 总统女士
thank you, Madam President.

353
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,980
如果我有100个理查德
If I had had 100 Richards,

354
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,380
谁知道我能做成什么呢
who knows what I could have done?

355
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,240
可能会很多
Probably a lot.

356
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:01,300
也可能最后像《阴阳魔界》里的场景
Or it could turn out like one of those "Twilight Zone" Scenarios

357
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,420
大家彼此谋杀
where we all murder each other.

358
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,860
我都不记得怎么开车了
I don't even remember how to drive.

359
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,000
- 我得买个钱包 - 大概吧
- I need a wallet. - Probably.

360
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,120
- 还有邮票 我要买点邮票 - 对
- And stamps. I've got to get stamps. - Yeah.

361
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,660
如果我是个小女孩 然后你对我说
If I was a little girl and you said to me,

362
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:16,440
"你想做什么"
"What do you want to do?"

363
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,980
我可能会说"可以让我做总统吗"
I would have said, "Please, can I be president?"

364
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,760
结果这成了我生命中最寂寞的12个月
And then it turned out to be the 12 loneliest months of my life.

365
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,840
我姨妈以前经常这样谈起寂寞
My auntie used to talk about loneliness like that.

366
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,100
- 好吧 - 对
- Okay, so, right, you know that. - Yeah, yeah.

367
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,880
我们曾经非常 非常亲近
We were pretty, pretty close,

368
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,540
特别是因为我妈妈太老了
especially 'cause my mother was so much older.

369
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,560
事实上 她老到足够当我祖母了
Old enough to be my grandmother, as a matter of fact.

370
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,960
- 对 - 对
- Yeah. - Yeah.

371
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:40,140
也许我姨妈是我亲妈
Maybe my auntie was actually my real mother

372
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,660
而我妈其实是我祖母
and my mother was actually my grandmother.

373
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,060
哇 这样合理多了
wow, that's starting to make a whole lot of sense.

374
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,800
除了我 大家都知道
Everybody knew about it but me, too.

375
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
这是要祈祷吗 女士
Are we praying, ma'am?

376
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,600
不 我只是要躺下
No, I'm just gonna lie down.

377
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,240
天啊
Oh, God.

378
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,920
我赢了就好了
I wish I had won.

379
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,380
我希望大家都赢
I wish everybody won.

380
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,360
女士?
Ma'am?

381
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:08,360
女士?
Ma'am?

382
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,360
女士? 好吧
Ma'am? Okay.

383
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,900
你能留下吗
Can you just stay?

384
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:18,640
当然 女士
Absolutely, ma'am.

385
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,560

389
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,000
- 发生了什么 - 我不知道
- What happened? - I don't know.

390
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,880
天啊 我没操理查德吧
Oh, my God, I hope I didn't fuck Richard.

391
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,420
什么
What?

392
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,740
- 需要帮忙吗 - 不
- Okay, you need some help? - No.

393
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,900
蒙特兹太太和她的家人在路上了
Okay, Mrs. Montez and her family, they're on their way.

394
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,140
你要在北门廊门口迎接他们
You're gonna greet them at the North Portico doorway.

395
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,680
妈妈
Mom.

396
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,800
你见我的影片了吗 硬盘丢了
Have you seen my film? The hard drive is missing.

397
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,580
亲爱的 看看你
Honey, look at you.

398
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,280
是啊 我一直在为拯救农场做宣传
Yeah, I've been working with this new stylist

399
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,360
所以请了个新的造型师
since I've been doing all this press for the rescue farm.

400
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,440
这是我的新形象
It's my new look.

401
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,040
妈妈 你会打理你的头发的 对吧
Mom, you're gonna do something with your hair, right?

402
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,760
天啊 看看这个
Oh, God. Look at this.

403
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,760
好了 你听我说 听我说
Okay, you listen to me. Listen to me.

404
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,240
他们可以夺走你的总统之位
They can take away your presidency,

405
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,160
你的权力 你的尊严
they can take away your power, they can take away your dignity,

406
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,900
但有一样他们夺不走的是什么
but what is the one thing that they cannot take away from you?

407
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,720
- 我的美 - 这就对了 我们走吧
- My beauty. - That's right. Let's go.

408
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,160
走后门 后门
Go back door! Back door!

409
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,040
举起来
Put it up!

410
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,740
- 就这样 - 你犯规
- That's it. - You fouled me.

411
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,140
你们知道整个该死的雷伯恩议会大厦
Do you realize the whole goddamn Rayburn House Office Building

412
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,260
都能听到你和你的废柴军团
can hear you and your twink

413
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,960
在这儿互插食道吗
army in here cock scraping each other's esophagi?

414
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,820
好的 先生 抱歉 先生 我们是在打闹
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. We were roughhousing.

415
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,360
天啊 威尔 你看到的也如我所见吗
Jesus, Will, are you looking at what I'm looking at here?

416
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,920
威尔 告诉他招聘男性员工的第一条法则
Will, tell him the first rule of hiring male staff.

417
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,700
他们魅力必须比议员少很多
They must be substantially less attractive than the congressman.

418
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,240
我差点雇了一个伊拉克老兵
And I almost hired an Iraqi war veteran.

419
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,840
半边脸三度烧伤
Third degree burns on half of his face,

420
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:53,440
不过他性格好 所以...
but the guy had personality, so...

421
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,260
威尔 告诉他为什么我雇了你
Will, tell him why I hired you instead.

422
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,800
因为我的外表和礼仪都招人烦
Because I'm repulsive both in appearance and manner.

423
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,660
在你像拉拉队长要堕的胎一样
Now let me give you some advice

424
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
被拽出去之前
before you're yanked out

425
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,580
我来给你些建议
of here like a cheerleader's unwanted fetus.

426
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,780
谨言慎行
You say nothing and you do less.

427
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,700
摘掉这个破眼睛
And take off those fucking glasses.

428
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,960
你看起来像克里斯托弗·里夫[超人扮演者]
You look like Clark Kent if they

429
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,200
被挖出来的尸体扮演的克拉克·肯特[超人]
dug up Christopher Reeve's corpse to play the part.

430
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,100
至于你们 各位女士 这里是华盛顿 不是迈阿密
And as for you ladies, this is DC, not Miami.

431
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,960
- 恭喜 乔纳 - 谢了
- Congratulations, Jonah. - Thanks, man.

432
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,300
操他大爷
Fuck that guy.

433
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,460
来啊 游戏开始 我们继续
Come on, let's go. Game on. Here we go.

434
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,880
- 好吗 预备 - 空中传球
- All right, ready? - Alley-oop!

435
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,440
我的蛋
My fucking nuts!

436
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,200
擦 柯尔特
shit, Colt.

437
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,900
叫个医生 打给我妈
Call a doctor and call my mom.

438
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:34,140
嘿 你用过那个杜鲁门保龄球馆吗
Hey, have you ever used that Truman bowling alley?

439
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,580
不 当然没有 我在这工作
No, no, of course not. I worked here.

440
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,780
我来白宫又不是为了庆祝四年级生日派对
I didn't go to the White House for a fourth grade birthday party.

441
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,040

新工作找得怎么样了
Any luck with the new job search?

451
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,880
没关系 我回到了《每日邮报》工作 所以我们还行
Oh, it's all right. I'm back at the "Post," So we're good. Yeah.

452
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,900

455
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,100
这位是艾伦
And this is Ellen,

456
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,680
我的新女儿 她3岁了

麦克 她的头围看上去已经六岁了

459
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,420
她说什么?
What did she say?

460
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,660
很有趣的事
Here's an interesting fact.

461
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,280
你知道这间屋在被涂红之前
Would you believe that it was called the Red Room

462
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,200
就被称作红屋了么？
before it was actually painted red?

463
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,360
我听说了
I heard that.

464
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,160
那时候刷这个屋要多少钱
What'd it cost to paint this thing back then?

465
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,560
- 12美元 - 12美元 我还以为15美元呢
- $12. - Yeah, $12. I was thinking right around 15.

466
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,940
当时还是奴隶制 所以可能不要钱
I think it was a slave state, so it might have been free.

467
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,180
我刚在想... 孩子们
Oh, I'm just wondering... boys.

468
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,380
- 孩子们 不要管他们 - 我儿子们像他们这么大的时候
- Boys. They're fine. - Hell, when my boys were that age,

469
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,780
能把这拆了
they'd have just torn this place apart.

470
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,560
我有三个儿子 我家闻上去就像是腋窝的味道
I have three boys. My entire house smells like an armpit.

471
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,680
真好我家是女儿
Ooh, hate to hear that. See, glad I have girls.

472
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,200
女孩们后来会让你更费心
Girls will cost you later.

473
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,340
女孩最不好了
Mm, girls are the worst.

474
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,460
我听说今晚气温要降到20度以下呢[-6.7摄氏度]
Well, I also heard that it might go down into the teens tonight.

475
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,040
为了舞会我得把皮草准备好吧
Hey, I better get out my fur for the ball tonight, right?

476
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,080
对啊
Yes, you should.

477
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,080
我恨不得每天都热
Well, give me the heat any day.

478
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,880
不过再说了 我是墨西哥长大的
But then again, I grew up in Mexico.

479
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,040
当然 我们知道

那热死了[西语]
Es muy caliente there.

482
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,560
劳拉 你又是来自俄亥俄州哪里的呢?[揭劳拉实为美国乡下人]
And where exactly in Ohio are you from, Laura?

483
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,580
我家
Um, well, I grew up

484
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,780
正好在克利夫兰旁边 但是
right outside of Cleveland, but after, you know,

485
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,640
15年过去了 我觉得自己就是个土生土长的新墨西哥人
15 years, I feel like I am 100% New Mexican.

486
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,000
新墨西哥 而不是墨西哥?
New Mexican, but not Mexican?

487
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,480
在所有白宫的传统中
Of all the White House traditions,

488
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,960
这一个应该是我最喜欢的
this one is probably my favorite.

489
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,160
- 是吗 - 是的
- Is it? Oh. - Yeah.

490
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,700
该死 刚才还有啊
Damn it. I just had it.

491
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,740
我每天都带着 但是现在我找不到了
I have this thing every day and now I can't find it.

492
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,160

581
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,580
也不擅长赢取竞选

582
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,680

Well, that's not true.

583

嗯...
Um...

585

我该写点什么吗 女士?
Was I supposed to write something, ma'am?

没人告诉我啊
Nobody told me.

588
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,760
我以为他要领养个婴儿
